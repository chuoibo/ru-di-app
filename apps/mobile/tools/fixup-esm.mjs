/* Make tsc's output loadable by Node, so tests can run the real modules.
 *
 * The app's own tsconfig uses bundler resolution, so source files import
 * `./fixtures/proposals` with no extension -- which is what Metro wants and
 * what the rest of the codebase is written in. Node refuses that. Rather than
 * bend the source to suit the test runner, bend the build output.
 *
 * Three rewrites, and the second and third exist so that screens -- not just
 * plain `.ts` logic -- can be rendered in a test:
 *
 *   1. relative specifiers get their extension back;
 *   2. `react-native` becomes `react-native-web`;
 *   3. JSON imports get the attribute Node demands.
 *
 * (2) is not a stub and not a mock. It is the same substitution Expo's web
 * build performs, so a component rendered this way goes through the library
 * that ships to the browser, and the DOM it produces is the DOM a visitor
 * gets. That is the whole point: the bug this enabled a test for --
 * `accessibilityState` reaching the browser as nothing -- lives *in* that
 * substitution, and no assertion about the source file could have seen it.
 * What it deliberately cannot prove is anything about iOS or Android, where a
 * different library reads the same props.
