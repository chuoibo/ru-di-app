/** What a person is allowed to read when the server itself is the thing that failed.
 *
 * Three of the four dead ends on Khám phá already wrap the server's own words
 * in a Vietnamese sentence and keep them behind a "Chi tiết:" label. The 5xx
 * branch did not: it assigned `state.detail` straight into the body, so the
 * phone showed `<html>502 Bad Gateway</html>` or `{"detail":"rate limited"}`
 * where a sentence belongs (bug-185426).
 *
 * The sentence is the readable half. The excerpt is the safe half, and it is
 * why this is a module rather than two string literals: a 5xx body is the one
 * string on these screens the app does not author. Turn on FastAPI's debug
 * pages, or put a proxy in front, and that body becomes a traceback, an
 * internal hostname, or a SQL statement, rendered full width at body size to
 * whoever is holding the phone. `places.ts` and `tim-kiem.ts` already cut it to
 * 200 characters, which bounds the damage but does not decide what a person
 * should see. That decision lives here.
 *
 * Kept out of `Kit.tsx` on purpose: this is copy, not a component, and both
 * halves have to be assertable without rendering anything.
