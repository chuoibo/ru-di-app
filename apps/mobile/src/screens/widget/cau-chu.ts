/** F38. The parts of the home widget worth testing without rendering anything.
 *
 * Same split `ca-nhan/tai-chinh.ts` and `ky-niem/ky-uc.ts` make, for the same
 * reason: the moment-line and the refusal words are where this screen can be
 * wrong in a way a screenshot cannot see, and both are pure functions of their
 * inputs here.
 *
 * Nothing in this file talks to the network. `api.ts` owns the request, because
 * the widget must go through the same `translated` refusal table every other
 * photo route goes through -- a second fetch with its own error handling is the
 * shape that ends up showing an English error code on a Vietnamese screen.
 */

/** How long ago, in the words a Vietnamese widget uses.
 *
 * `now` is a parameter and not `Date.now()`. Two reasons, and the second is the
 * one that has bitten this repo: a frozen clock inside a formatter makes every
 * mutation of the window boundaries invisible, because the test and the code
 * read the same standing value and agree with each other about a moment that
 * never moves. Passing it in means a test can stand at 11:59 and at 12:01 of
 * the same boundary and get two different answers.
 *
 * `Intl` / `toLocaleString` are refused for the reason `ky-uc.ts` states: Hermes
 * ships without full ICU unless the app opts in, so the fallback is the C locale
 * and the failure is invisible on the web build where Intl works fine.
 *
 * A timestamp in the future is not an error and is not clamped to a negative
 * count: clocks disagree by seconds all the time, and "trong 0 phút nữa" on a
 * photograph somebody just posted would read as a bug in the product rather
 * than as a two-second skew between a phone and a server. It reads "vừa xong".
