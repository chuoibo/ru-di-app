 * key come from `api.ts`, because a second `fetch` wrapper would be a second
 * status-to-sentence table, and the one that already exists was tuned against
 * a real server.
 *
 * Naming a person is not here at all -- `registerPerson` in `api.ts` already
 * does it and is already pinned by tests. F01 and F03 call that one. Two
 * functions writing `PUT /people/{id}` would be two places to get the retry
 * key wrong, and the expense flow would keep the good one.

/**
 * The person id for a telephone number (F01, and bug-140342).
 *
 * The derivation used to be arithmetic in `danh-tinh.ts` and is now a request,
 * for one reason: it had to become keyed, and there is nowhere on this device
 * to keep a key. `person_identity.py` carries the measurement -- an id was
 * reversible back into its number at 257,316 candidates per second.
 *
 * So the digits now leave the device, which is a real cost and is why the
 * screen's own copy had to change with this call rather than after it. They go
 * in a POST body and not in a path, so uvicorn's access log does not see them,
 * and the server stores nothing.
 *
 * No idempotency key. The call writes nothing -- it is a pure function of the
 * number and the server's key -- so keying it would put a read into the
 * server's attempt store to protect a retry that was already safe.
 *
 * No actor header either, and that one is not an oversight: somebody signing
 * in does not have an id yet, which is the thing being asked for.
 *
 * Normalises before sending rather than shipping whatever is in the field. The
 * server normalises too and would reach the same answer, but sending the
 * canonical form means a stray space never travels, and it keeps the two
 * copies of the rule honest -- if they ever disagree, they disagree here at
 * one call site instead of silently across every sign-in.
