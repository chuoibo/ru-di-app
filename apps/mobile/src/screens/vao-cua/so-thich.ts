/** F01.03 -- what the personalization step collects, and where it stops.
 *
 * React-free on purpose, like `danh-tinh.ts` beside it. The parts of this
 * screen that can be wrong -- the money in the budget presets, which answers
 * are optional, what a refused permission means -- are checked by
 * `tests/so-thich.test.mjs` rather than by looking at a phone.
 *
 * ## The honest boundary, stated once and not buried
 *
 * There is no route to save these answers. Measured against the running API of
 * this branch: `/people/{person_id}` has no preferences body, and the only
 * preference route the server has at all is
 * `GET /contexts/{context_id}/preference-profile` -- read-only, and about a
 * *group*, which does not exist yet at the moment somebody finishes signing
 * up. So the answers live in this module for the length of the session and are
 * gone on reload.
 *
 * That makes persistence a shell, and naming it here is the point: a screen
 * that collects taste and quietly drops it is indistinguishable, from the
 * outside, from one that saved it. Whoever adds `PUT /people/{id}/preferences`
 * replaces `ghiNhoSoThich` and nothing else on the screen changes.
 *
 * What is *not* a shell: every choice below is real state, reaches the
 * caller, and the budget is real money under this repo's first law.
 *
 * ## Why the budget is a range of integers and not a number
 *
 * Law 1 is integer đồng, including intermediate values, and a "budget" typed
 * as one number invites the average of a range -- which is how `225000.5`
 * enters a product that has no halves of a đồng. A preset is two integer
 * bounds and no arithmetic is done on them here.
 *
 * `null` is a legal answer and is not "unknown means cheap": the mockup's own
 * rule is that a skipped budget leaves recommendation on default rather than
 * guessing hard, so `khoang` stays absent instead of being filled in with the
 * middle preset.
