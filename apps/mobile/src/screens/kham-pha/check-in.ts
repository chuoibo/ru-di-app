/** F46. Two requests: the group was here, and who else has been.
 *
 * Kept out of the screen for the usual reason -- the wire shape and the
 * refusal wording are the parts that can be wrong, and neither needs a phone
 * to check. `tests/check-in.test.mjs` reads them.
 *
 * ## What the request does NOT carry
 *
 * A latitude. A longitude. A GPS reading of any kind.
 *
 * The body is `{place_id}` and the server looks the rest up in its own
 * catalogue. That is a deliberate refusal of the easier design: if this file
 * could send coordinates, it could write "the group was at 0,0" -- or at
 * somebody's home address -- into a group's permanent history, and no later
 * reader would have anything to check it against. Automatic place detection
 * from the phone's GPS is **F47** and is not built; a body with coordinates in
 * it would make this route look like it had been.
 *
 * ## What comes back is private
 *
 * A check-in list is where a group of people physically were and when. It
 * leaves the server only through `GET /contexts/{id}/memories`, which is gated
 * on membership, and it does not get logged here. `console.log` of a response
 * in this file would put a group's movements in a browser console during a
 * demo.
