/** F12 -- "quán nướng ngoài trời cho 6 người dưới 300k" asked out loud.
 *
 * `POST /places/search` is real: `services/api/app/api/routes/places.py`, work
 * item **rd-be-10**. React-free on purpose, like `places.ts` beside it, so the
 * parts that can be wrong -- the wire shape, the reading of `source`, the
 * refusal to invent a result -- are checked by `tests/tim-dia-diem.test.mjs`
 * rather than by looking at a phone.
 *
 * ## The sentence goes to the server untouched
 *
 * `askSearch` sends `{ query }` and nothing else. It does not prepend a
 * template, append the group profile, wrap the text in quotes, or glue on a
 * category the person happened to have selected. That is not tidiness: this
 * text reaches a model prompt, so it is the app's first real prompt-injection
 * surface, and every string this file concatenated around it would be a second
 * place where an instruction could be smuggled in and a second thing the
 * server's grounding could not see. The server owns the prompt. The client
 * owns one field.
 *
 * The only thing done to the text is `trim()` and a length cap, both of which
 * mirror constraints the server already enforces (`MAX_QUERY_CHARS = 300`,
 * blank rejected). Mirroring a limit is not composing a prompt; it spends one
 * fewer round trip to say the same no.
 *
 * ## Why `source: "ai"` with no places is not a failure
 *
 * The server distinguishes two outcomes the screen must never merge:
 *
 * * **`source: "ai"`, `places: []`** -- a model answered, the answer was
 *   grounded, and the honest answer was that nothing in the catalogue fits.
 *   `understood` is present, and this is precisely where it earns its place on
 *   screen: someone who typed "dưới 30k" and gets nothing needs to see that the
 *   AI read 30.000đ, not 300.000đ.
 * * **`source: "none"`** -- no model answer survived. The model was
 *   unreachable, or it named a place that does not exist and `ground_search`
 *   refused the whole reply rather than serving the part that happened to be
 *   real. `understood` is null because there is no reading to show.
 *
 * The route deliberately returns 200 for the second case, with an empty list,
 * and deliberately does not send the refusal code to the client. So this file
 * cannot -- and must not try to -- tell the person *which* of those causes
 * happened. `khong-tra-loi` says the true, narrow thing: nothing came back for
 * this sentence. Guessing a cause on screen would be inventing the one piece of
 * information the server withheld on purpose.
