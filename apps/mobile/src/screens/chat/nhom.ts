/** Why this screen cannot use the group id already sitting in `api.ts`.
 *
 * `CONTEXT_ID` there (`1aa00000-aaaa-…`) was minted so the expense flow had
 * *a* group to agree on across screens. It has never had a row in the
 * `contexts` table. Membership is not the actor header either: the server
 * computes `is_group_member` with `repository.is_member(context_id, actor.id)`,
 * a real query. Posting a chat message under that synthetic id is a 403
 * `permission_denied` with certainty, and the thread would then look empty
 * for a reason the empty-state copy could not name.
 *
 * The app opens the group the session already holds (`moNhomDaCo`): only
 * step 4 below runs. `khoiDongNhom` is the end-to-end harness's way to reach
 * a seeded group on a throwaway stack (`tests/e2e`, via
 * `rudi/nhom-demo.ts`); no screen calls it.
 *
 * It builds the group the way `scripts/seed_demo_data.py` does, through the
 * HTTP API, in four steps that are stable under retry:
 *
 *   1. `PUT /people/{id}` for the person signed in, and for `minh` (the
 *      creator). Without a people row, `POST /contexts` is a 500 on a
 *      foreign key, which is how this product used to greet every caller.
 *   2. `POST /contexts` as `minh`, idempotency key `uuid5(ns, "write:context")`.
 *      If the seed already ran, the middleware replays the original group.
 *      If it did not, this creates it and makes `minh` the admin. One call,
 *      two circumstances, one stable id.
 *   3. If the signed-in person is not `minh`: invite (as `minh`) then accept
 *      (as themselves). A 409 on accept is SUCCESS -- they are already in.
 *      Treating it as a fault would strand a seeded member behind a
 *      "could not join" banner on every launch.
 *   4. `GET /contexts/{id}/members` for the list the header prints. The
 *      number of members is this list's length, never a fixture.
 *
 * Every write carries a derived idempotency key, so pressing again replays
 * instead of doubling. Every failure names the step that died and the
 * address that was tried, because "không vào được nhóm" without either is
 * how an afternoon gets spent restarting a server that was fine.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The replay in step 2 is byte-fragile, and the bytes are not ours to choose.
 *
 * The server fingerprints an idempotent write as
 * `sha256(method + path + query + RAW BODY BYTES)` -- see
 * `services/api/app/api/idempotency.py`, `request_fingerprint`. Raw bytes, not
 * parsed JSON. Two encoders that agree on the value disagree on the bytes:
 *
 *   Python  json.dumps  -> {"display_name": "Team Đà Lạt"}
 *   JS      JSON.stringify -> {"display_name":"Team Đà Lạt"}
 *
 * Same key, same meaning, different digest, so the second one is rejected
 * `422 idempotency_key_reuse`. The seed script gets there first on every demo
 * machine, which meant this screen could never open the group: it showed a
 * raw English server string where the member list belongs. Measured, not
 * guessed -- posting both byte strings under one key returns 201 and 422.
 *
 * Exactly one write is exposed: the group create. It is the only key both
 * programs derive the same way -- `write:context` on each side. The seed keys
 * a person by `write:person:<uuid>` where this file uses `write:<slug>`, and
 * an invite by `write:invite:<uuid>` against `write:invite:<slug>`, so those
 * never meet and keep `JSON.stringify`. Narrow the workaround to the write
 * that needs it; a project-wide encoder swap would be a much larger claim
 * than the evidence supports.
 *
 * There is no `GET /contexts`, so replay is the only route to the seeded
 * group -- inventing a fresh key would create a SECOND "Team Đà Lạt" beside
 * the one holding the members and the history. So the idempotent writes below
 * are serialised by `thanNhuSeed`, which reproduces Python's default
 * `json.dumps` output byte for byte.
 *
 * This is a workaround wearing its reason on its sleeve, not a design. The
 * durable fix is server-side (fingerprint canonical JSON, or expose a way to
 * look a context up) and has been reported to the backend lane. When that
 * lands, `thanNhuSeed` should go and `JSON.stringify` should come back.
