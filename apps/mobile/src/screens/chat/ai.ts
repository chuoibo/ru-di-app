/** Why the AI turn has five outcomes and not two.
 *
 * THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN AGAINST THE REAL CONTRACT. The first version was
 * written while rd-be-04 was unmerged and guessed the wire: it POSTed
 * `{after_message_id}`, read `{speak: false}`, and looked for `kind:
 * "ai_card"` at the top level of the body. rd-be-04 landed (main @ 7e1db9a)
 * and the route takes NO body and answers `CompanionTurnResponse`:
 * `{context_id, spoke, reason, message}`. Every field the guess read is
 * absent, so the guessed client would have classified every real answer as
 * `hong` while its tests stayed green against the guessed shape.
 *
 * The interesting part is `spoke: false`, which arrives for six different
 * reasons that are NOT the same event:
 *
 *   no_conversation · already_spoke_last · rate_limited · cooldown
 *       -- `plan_turn` decided not to speak. This is the ceiling working.
 *          An AI that answers every message is annoying, not clever. Show
 *          nothing at all; there is no news here.
 *
 *   unavailable
 *       -- the model call itself failed: no key, a network fault, a
 *          malformed answer. Folding this into silence is the tempting bug,
 *          and it is the dishonest one. A deployment with no GEMINI_API_KEY
 *          would then look exactly like an AI that read the thread and had
 *          nothing to add, forever, and nobody would ever find out.
 *
 *   ungrounded
 *       -- the model named a place that is not in the server catalogue, so
 *          `ground_card` threw away the WHOLE card (rd-be-04 QĐ-2: rejecting
 *          the card is observable, quietly dropping one stop is not). This is
 *          the anti-fabrication guard firing. It is the system behaving
 *          correctly, but it is still a reason the user saw no answer, so it
 *          gets its own calm sentence rather than being hidden.
 *
 * There is a ninth outcome that never arrives in `reason` at all: HTTP 429
 * from the per-person ceiling, 30 turns in 60 seconds, checked BEFORE the
 * cadence rules ever run. It is the same class of event as `rate_limited` and
 * is drawn the same way, so it lives in the sentence table beside them rather
 * than in the generic error path, whose only reason to exist is a status
 * nobody predicted.
 *
 * `chua-noi-duoc` survives from the first version for one honest reason: a
 * 404 still means this build of the API predates rd-be-04, and the app can be
 * pointed at an older server than the one on main today.
 *
 * Activation has TWO shapes, and the difference decides how silence is drawn.
 *
 * The original shape is "a new text just landed in the group": the client
 * offers a turn and the companion volunteers or does not. Nobody is waiting on
 * an answer, so `cooldown` and `already_spoke_last` draw nothing.
 *
 * The second shape is a person pressing "Hỏi Rủ Đi AI". That turn carries
 * `{"requested": true}`, which the server (PR 378) reads as permission to skip
 * the cadence rules -- not the per-window ceiling, which is the bill. And here
 * the same `spoke: false` means something else entirely: a question was asked
 * and dropped on the floor. So `hoiThang` turns every silence into a
 * `khong-tra-loi-duoc` with a sentence. The user pressed a button; a screen
 * that does not move afterwards is indistinguishable from a dead app, and that
 * is the exact defect this flag exists to fix.
 *
 * The flag is sent ONLY on the asked turn. Setting it on every turn would buy
 * nothing (the ceiling is unchanged) and cost the cadence: the companion would
 * answer every single line of a fast exchange.
 *
 * Nothing here ever renders a sentence this client wrote as though the model
 * wrote it. The only text that reaches a bubble comes from `message.card`.

/**
 * One sentence per outcome, and no two the same.
 *
 * Every silence used to collapse into three sentences: the three cadence
 * reasons shared one, and `unavailable` shared the catch-all with any name a
 * later server might invent. Two people hitting two different ceilings read
 * the same words, so neither could tell what to do next, and the one outcome
 * that means "the AI is down" was written in the same voice as the one that
 * means "keep chatting".
 *
 * Rules the wording follows, each of them load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Say what unblocks it, in the unit that actually unblocks it.** The
 *    90-second rule is a clock, so its sentence gives seconds. The window
 *    ceiling is 3 companion turns inside the last 20 messages, which is a
 *    COUNT: waiting changes nothing there and only new messages push the old
 *    turns out of the window, so promising "thử lại sau N phút" would be a
 *    clock that does not exist. The per-person 429 is a real 60-second
 *    window, and that one does say a minute.
 *  - **Never print the server's own machine words.** The 429 body carries
 *    `companion_turn_rate_limited`; before this, that string reached the
 *    screen through the generic error path, under "Máy chủ trả lỗi 429".
 *  - **Never say why the model failed.** `unavailable` covers a missing key,
 *    a provider 429, a timeout and a malformed answer (PR 420), and the
 *    server drops the difference on purpose because the provider's error text
 *    can carry the API key and the group's own words. The sentence says the
 *    AI side is down and that the group did nothing wrong, which is the whole
 *    of what is known.
 *  - **No "lỗi", no status codes, no em dash.**
 *
 * The numbers 90, 3 and 20 are `DEFAULT_LIMITS` in `app/domain/companion.py`;
 * 60 is `RECEIPT_SCAN_WINDOW_SECONDS`, which the companion limiter reuses.
 * `cau-chu-im-lang.test.mjs` reads them back out of the Python and fails if
 * this copy still quotes an old number.
