/** Why a card is parsed before anything of it is drawn.
 *
 * The AI's answer arrives as `card`, a free dict on the wire. A screen that
 * renders `undefined` for a missing time looks like a styling bug and gets
 * chased in the wrong file for an hour; a parser that drops the stage and
 * keeps the rest is read once.
 *
 * THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN AGAINST THE REAL CONTRACT. The first version was
 * written while rd-be-04 was still unmerged, against a shape guessed from the
 * mockup: `{tieuDe, ngay: [{nhan, chang: [...]}], tongDuTinhVnd, soNguoi}`.
 * rd-be-04 landed (main @ 7e1db9a) and the shape the server actually emits is
 * `{kind, payload}` with three kinds. Every field name in the guess was wrong.
 * Keeping the guess would have meant `keHoachTuCard` returning `null` for
 * every real card and the Plan tab reading "chưa có kế hoạch" forever, while
 * the tests stayed green because they fed it the guessed shape.
 *
 * Two things the real contract does NOT have, and which this file therefore
 * refuses to invent:
 *
 *  1. NO DAY GROUPING. `stops` is one flat list. The mockup draws "Ngày 1 /
 *     Ngày 2" tabs and the task sheet asked for them, but nothing on the wire
 *     says which stop belongs to which day. Splitting the list on a guess (by
 *     count, or by parsing `time_text` for a wrap-around) would put a day
 *     boundary on screen that the server never asserted. One timeline.
 *  2. NO MONEY TOTALS. `ground_card` rebuilds the payload from a key
 *     whitelist, and that whitelist has no `amount`, no `total`, no
 *     `per_person` -- deliberately, so a model cannot invent a number that
 *     looks like a settled share. The only money here is `price_min_vnd` /
 *     `price_max_vnd`, copied from the server's own place catalogue. This
 *     client adds nothing up. This product has one splitter and it lives on
 *     the server behind 41 hand-computed golden vectors.
 *
 * One thing the contract DID gain, in PR 181 (bug-223917). The PR number is
 * written bare here, without the usual hash, because the hex-colour gate over
 * this directory matches a hash followed by three hex digits and 181 is three
 * hex digits. `_ground_itinerary`
 * keeps 6 stops and `ground_card` keeps 6 places, and both used to drop the
 * tail without a trace, so a group that asked for "cả hai ngày" got one day
 * and no way to tell. The server now adds `omitted_stop_count` /
 * `omitted_place_count`, `int > 0`, PRESENT ONLY WHEN SOMETHING WAS CUT. A
 * short card carries neither key, which is why they parse to `undefined`
 * rather than `0`: the screen must be able to distinguish "nothing was cut"
 * from "two stops are gone", and a zero makes those two the same value.
 *
 * `theTuCard` returning `null` is the honest answer for garbage, an unknown
 * kind, or an empty list. The screen then says there is no plan yet -- the
 * same rule as a missing `GET /places`, for the same reason: a canned
 * itinerary on screen is indistinguishable from one the model wrote, and that
 * is the thing the acceptance criteria forbid.
