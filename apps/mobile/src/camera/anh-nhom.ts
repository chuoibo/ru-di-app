/** Choosing a photograph to keep, and getting it off the phone cleanly.
 *
 * This is the group-photo and avatar counterpart to `bill-photo.ts`, and the
 * two are deliberately separate modules rather than one with a flag. They look
 * alike -- pick, shrink, hand the bytes to a caller, delete the temporary
 * files -- and they are answering different questions:
 *
 *   - A bill is read and thrown away. `MAX_BYTES` there is a tripwire proving
 *     compression actually ran, because an uncompressed 6 MB capture reaching
 *     the reader would look like success. Its sentences say "chụp lại gần hơn",
 *     which is advice about a piece of paper.
 *   - A memory photo is *kept*. It is going into the group's wall and people
 *     will look at it later, so shrinking it to bill dimensions would be
 *     destroying the thing the feature exists to store. Its sentences are about
 *     choosing a different picture, because there is nothing to re-photograph.
 *
 * Merging them would mean one function whose constants and whose words both
 * depend on a caller-supplied mode, which is two functions wearing one name.
 * What is shared is shared for real: the `PhotoBackend` contract and the
 * `BillPhoto` shape come from `bill-photo.ts` rather than being restated, so
 * there is still exactly one native adapter for both paths.
 *
 * The cleanup promise is the same and is the reason this is a `with`-shaped
 * function rather than a `pick()` that returns a uri. The caller is never
 * handed a file it has to remember to delete, so it cannot forget -- and the
 * file most worth deleting is the one left behind when the upload *failed*,
 * which is the path nobody exercises by hand.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does not do:
 *
 *  - **It does not strip EXIF, and does not claim to.** The server sanitises
 *    every uploaded image: it decodes, drops metadata, and re-encodes. Doing it
 *    here as well would be a second implementation of a privacy guarantee, and
 *    the weaker of the two -- this one runs only when this code path is used,
 *    the server's runs on every byte that arrives. `exif: false` at the picker
 *    is asked for anyway, because not reading a coordinate is strictly better
 *    than reading it and discarding it, but the guarantee is the server's.
 *  - **It does not know a URL.** Nothing here uploads. `api.ts` is the only
 *    file that names a host, which is what keeps "where can a photo of my
 *    friends go" answerable by reading one file.
