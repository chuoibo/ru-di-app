/** Getting a bill photo small enough to send, and gone once it is sent.
 *
 * A bill is sensitive: it carries what a group ate, where, when, and often a
 * bank line at the bottom. The repo rules say photos of bills never enter git;
 * the same reasoning applies to the phone. So this module holds three promises
 * and the tests pin all three:
 *
 *   1. **Never into the photo library.** We capture into the app's own cache
 *      directory and never call MediaLibrary. Nothing here asks for write
 *      access to the camera roll, and nothing should start.
 *   2. **Nowhere but our own API.** This module hands back bytes; it does not
 *      know a URL. Anything that uploads is `api.ts`, which talks to exactly
 *      one host.
 *   3. **Temporary files are deleted after reading.** Including when the read
 *      throws -- see `withBillPhoto`. A failed upload leaving the original
 *      full-resolution capture in the cache is the leak nobody notices,
 *      because the happy path looks clean.
 *
 * EXIF is dropped, and that is a privacy decision rather than a size one. A
 * phone camera writes GPS into every frame by default, so a bill photo says
 * where the group was sitting. The compression step re-encodes without it, and
 * `exif: false` at the capture call means it is never written in the first
 * place.
 *
 * The native calls are injected as `PhotoBackend` rather than imported. That is
 * what lets the node test runner drive the whole lifecycle -- including the
 * delete-on-failure path, which is impossible to trigger reliably on a real
 * device and is precisely the path worth testing.

/** What a person is told when the platform could not compress the photo at all.
 *
 * bug-010822. Everything the backends throw here arrives in one of three
 * shapes, and only one of them is safe to put on a screen:
 *
 *   - A `BillPhotoError` we raised ourselves further down. It already carries
 *     the sentence we chose, so it is passed straight through. Flattening these
 *     would turn "Ảnh bill quá lớn để gửi đi" into a decode failure and send
 *     someone to fix the wrong thing.
 *   - A value that is not an `Error`. On the web this means exactly one thing:
 *     `expo-image-manipulator` rejects with the `HTMLCanvasElement` it was
 *     going to draw into when the browser cannot decode the source
 *     (`src/web/utils.web.ts`, `imageSource.onerror = () => reject(canvas)`).
 *     A file that will not decode is not an image, and that is what we say.
 *   - A real `Error` from the platform, whose message is English machine text
 *     like "Failed to create canvas context". Honest, useless, and not ours to
 *     show, so it becomes a sentence and keeps the original as `cause`.
 *
 * The middle case is the one rd-qa-37 hit, and it is worth being precise about
 * why "not an `Error`" is allowed to mean "not an image" rather than being a
 * guess. It is not an inference about JavaScript in general; it is the observed
 * contract of the one backend that can produce it. The third case is the
 * fallback for everything else, so being wrong about the middle one costs a
 * slightly-too-specific sentence, never a leaked machine string.
