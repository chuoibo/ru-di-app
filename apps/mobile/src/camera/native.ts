 * is why it is the only one the node test runner cannot load. It is kept as
 * thin as it can be: every decision worth testing lives in `bill-photo.ts` or
 * `access.ts`, and what remains here is the adapter that `tsc --noEmit` and the
 * web export build check.
 *
 * All four modules used here ship inside Expo Go, deliberately. The phone path
 * from `scripts/phone_path.py` is "scan a QR with Expo Go"; a module that needs
 * a custom dev client would break that path for everyone, and we would find out
 * on a phone rather than in CI.
