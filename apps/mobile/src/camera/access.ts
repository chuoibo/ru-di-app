/** Whether this device will let us open a camera, and what to do when it will not.
 *
 * Kept free of `expo-camera` on purpose. Everything here is a pure function of
 * a permission response, so the node test runner can walk every branch without
 * a device -- and a device is exactly what we do not have in CI. The native
 * calls live in `native.ts`, which this file never imports.
 *
 * The failure this file exists to prevent is a white screen. An app that asks
 * for the camera, gets "no", and renders nothing looks broken rather than
 * refused, and the person holding the phone has no way to tell which. So every
 * state below carries a sentence and a next action; there is no state that
 * means "render nothing".
 *
 * The distinction that actually matters is `denied` with `canAskAgain: false`.
 * Calling `requestPermission()` again in that state resolves immediately with
 * another `denied` and shows the user no dialog at all -- the OS has stopped
 * delivering the prompt. A button wired to "ask again" there is a button that
 * does nothing, which is worse than no button. That state has to route to
 * system settings instead, and `nextAction` says so.
 */

/** The shape `expo-camera` and `expo-image-picker` both return.
 *
 * Declared structurally rather than imported so this module stays out of the
 * native dependency graph. If expo changes the shape, `native.ts` stops
 * compiling -- that is the intended tripwire.
