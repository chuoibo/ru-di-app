/** Talks to services/api, for real.
 *
 * This file has carried two fakes. First its own even split --
 * `Math.floor(total / n)`, under a docstring saying nothing here computes
 * money. Then a fixture replayer that refused any amount not in a corpus:
 * honest, and useless in front of anyone, because typing a real number got a
 * refusal. Both are gone. It speaks the actual HTTP contract now.
 *
 * Nothing here computes money. The split comes from the server, which calls
 * the allocator that 41 hand-computed golden vectors are pinned against. A
 * second implementation in TypeScript would be a second thing to get wrong,
 * and `tests/offline.test.mjs` fails if one reappears.
 *
 * Three shapes the API insists on, each of which the app used to get wrong:
 *
 * - **Participants are UUIDs.** They were `p1`, `p2` -- readable, and rejected
 *   by every endpoint. Ids are minted per person in `participants.ts`.
 * - **Confirming re-sends the allocation that was on screen.** Not politeness:
 *   the server compares it against what it would compute now and refuses on a
 *   mismatch, so an expense that changed between looking and pressing cannot
 *   be confirmed by somebody who never saw the change.
 * - **Publishing names its batch.** The app called `/batches/current/publish`,
 *   a route that has never existed.
 *
 * There is no silent fallback to fixtures. If the API cannot be reached the
 * screen says so and names the address it tried. A demo that quietly runs on
 * made-up data is the failure this file keeps being rewritten to avoid.

 * What a person reads when the server refuses, whatever the server sent.

 *  - **`detail` is not always a string.** The API has one handler, for
 *    `ApiProblem`, which does emit `{code, detail}` with a Vietnamese sentence.
 *    Nothing handles FastAPI's own `RequestValidationError`, so a malformed
 *    body comes back as `{"detail": [{type, loc, msg, input}, ...]}`. Measured
 *    against `create_app()`: `POST /expenses {"nope": 1}` answered 422 with
 *    three of those. Assigning that list to an `Error` message stringifies it,
 *    and the banner rendered `[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]`.
 *  - **The fallback was written for whoever was debugging.**
 *    `` `${method} ${path} trả về ${response.status}` `` is a log line. It named
 *    the route and the status and told a person nothing they could act on.
 *
 * The server's *good* sentences still win, and that is the half worth guarding:
 * `SCAN_REFUSALS` and the publish table exist because those sentences are
 * specific and correct. Replacing them with a generic apology would be the
 * same defect facing the other way, so a string that reads as Vietnamese prose
 * is passed through untouched and only the machine text is replaced.

 * the fallback, and a raw UUID does not tell two of those apart for a human
 * reader either -- it only looks as though it does.

 * with the arguments they had when they were written. A missing list there

 *
 *  - **No `Content-Type` header.** `actorHeaders` sets `application/json`, and

 *    boundary has to be chosen by whatever assembles the `FormData`, so the
 *    header must be *absent*, not merely different.
 *  - **The field is called `file`.** Not `image`, which is what
 *    `POST /receipts/scan` calls its own. A mismatch is a 422 that says nothing
 *    about field names.
 *  - **`X-Actor-Roles` is required.** Without `member` in it the server answers
 *    403 `role_not_permitted`, which reads exactly like "you are not in this
 *    group" and sends somebody to fix their membership instead of the header.
 *  - **Two ways to put a file in a `FormData`.** React Native accepts
 *    `{uri, name, type}` and streams the file. On the web the manipulator hands
 *    back a `blob:` url, and that object appends as the literal string
 *    "[object Object]".
 *
 * Deliberately does not go through `call`: that function sets a JSON
 * `Content-Type` and `JSON.stringify`s its body, both of which are wrong here.
 * It does not reuse `scanReceipt`'s copy of the same logic either. That one
 * sits on the bill path, which has been repaired twice in two days, and folding
 * a second caller into it now would put this feature's bugs and the hero flow's
 * bugs in one place. The duplication is named rather than hidden, and the day
 * the bill path is next opened is the day to merge them.
 *
 * No `Idempotency-Key`. The middleware fingerprints method + path + body, and a
 * body here is several megabytes of JPEG; the protection that matters for this
 * feature is the one on the write that *references* the photo, which is where
 * the key is sent. Uploading the same picture twice costs a stored blob nobody
 * points at, not a duplicated row on anybody's wall.

 * a header:
 *
 *     GET /people/{id}/avatar          without X-Actor-ID -> 401
 *     GET /contexts/{cid}/photos/{pid} without X-Actor-ID -> 401
 *
 * An `<img>` cannot send a header, and react-native-web's `<Image>` becomes an
 * `<img>`. So `<Image source={{uri: "/people/x/avatar"}}>` is not "the read path
 * wired up" -- it is a request that is *guaranteed* to be refused. Worse, the
 * refusal is silent: `Anh` reacts to a failed load by drawing its stand-in, and
 * the stand-in for an avatar is the person's initials, which is exactly what a
 * person with no photograph yet also sees. Upload returns 201, the picture
 * never appears, and every surface agrees that nothing is wrong. That is what
 * shipped in rd-fe-25 and what #222 was sent back for.
 *
 * React Native's own `Image` does accept `source={{uri, headers}}`, so a native
 * build could pass the header through. react-native-web ignores it. Fetching
 * the bytes here instead is one path that works on both, and it keeps the rule
 * in one place rather than leaving web quietly broken.
 *
 * ## What comes back
 *
 * A `blob:` URL where the platform has one, a `data:` URL where it does not.
 * Both are local, so the frame that displays it makes no second request and
 * carries no header of its own. Hand the result to `boNguonCucBo` when the
 * frame is done with it; a `blob:` URL pins its bytes in memory until revoked.
 *
 * `contexts` matters for the group wall and not for an avatar: the photo route
 * checks membership of the context in the address, and the avatar route checks
 * whether the two people share one. Passing it wrong is a 403, not a leak --
