/** What the reader said a bill contains, and what a person changed about it.
 *
 * Two halves, on purpose:
 *
 *   - the wire half speaks `POST /receipts/scan` exactly as
 *     `services/api/app/api/schemas.py` declares it, snake_case and all;
 *   - the editable half is what the screen holds while somebody corrects it.
 *
 * They are separate because the reading is evidence and the edit is a
 * decision. Keeping the first transcription next to the corrected value is
 * what lets the screen say "you changed this" instead of quietly presenting a
 * human number as something the machine read.
 *
 * Money here obeys the same three laws as the rest of the product. Every
 * amount is an integer of dong; there is no `Number(text)` anywhere in this
 * file, because `parseAmountVnd` in `packages/shared/money.mjs` is the one
 * parser that checks the digit string before it becomes a double. And nothing
 * here divides anything between people: this module produces the *bill*, and
 * the allocator on the server produces the split. A second division in
 * TypeScript is how two screens end up showing two numbers for one dinner.
 *
 * One thing this module deliberately does NOT do: reconcile. If the item lines
 * add up to 1.129.000 and the paper says 1.125.000, both numbers survive and
 * `totalGapVnd` reports the distance. Silently adjusting either one would erase
 * the single most useful signal a receipt reader can give -- that it misread a
 * digit somewhere, and a person should look.
