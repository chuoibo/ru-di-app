/** Who ate which line of a bill, as data the screen holds.

 * here is how two screens end up showing two numbers for one dinner.
 *
 * `shared_by` is emitted in a canonical order (sorted ids) so the same set of
 * ticks serialises to the same bytes. The preview reuses one idempotency key
 * per signature; a body that drifted with tick-order would earn 422 instead
