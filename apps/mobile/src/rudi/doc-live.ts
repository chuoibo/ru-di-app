/**
 * The settlement screen's numbers, read from the server instead of the fixture.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * No arithmetic. `GET /contexts/{id}/balances` recomputes net-per-person and a
 * minimal transfer set from the ledger on every request, and `src/rudi/money.ts`
 * is a DRAFT over a fixture that exists only so two screens cannot print two
 * different constants. Running both and picking one would be the second
 * allocator the repo has already thrown out once (PR13-02), and the two
 * disagree about who absorbs the rounding đồng. In live mode the draft is not
 * consulted at all.
 *
 * ## What the recap total is, and what it is not
 *
 * `/balances` answers "who owes whom", not "what did this trip cost". The
 * figure the settlement hero shows comes from `GET /contexts/{id}/recap`, whose
 * per-trip `split_total_vnd` is recomputed per request over the expenses that
 * fall on that trip's days. The top-level `split_total_vnd` sums FINISHED trips
 * only, so on a group whose only trip is still under way the server answers
 * `0` -- an honest sum over an empty list, and the wrong number to print under
 * "tổng chi tiêu" on the day a bill was just written. So this reads the trips
 * themselves: a trip under way shows its running figure (`in_progress`),
 * finished trips show their sum, and a group with no trip says so instead of
 * printing 0đ. `null` is reserved for "the recap could not be read".
 *
 * ## Names
 *
 * `/balances` speaks in person UUIDs. A screen that prints a UUID where a name
 * belongs is the defect `tests/ten-dia-diem-album.test.mjs` was written for, one
 * layer over. Names come from `GET /contexts/{id}/members`, and a member the
 * roster does not know falls back to a neutral label -- never to the fixture
 * roster, which would put a demo person's name on a real person's debt.
