/**
 * What a cold-start URL means, decided before anything navigates.
 *
 * ## The defect this replaces
 *
 * `LegacyFragmentAdapter` used to read
 *
 *     if (pathname !== "/") return;
 *     void Linking.getInitialURL().then((url) => { ... router.replace(...) });
 *
 * The guard is synchronous and the redirect is not. On a cold start expo-router
 * renders `/` for a frame before it resolves the deep link, so the guard passed,
 * the promise then resolved, and `router.replace("/welcome")` fired on top of
 * the route the link had just opened. Measured on Expo Go 57 / SDK 57:
 * `exp://localhost:8095/--/settlements/team-da-lat` landed on the welcome
 * screen 4 times out of 4, and deleting the one `<LegacyFragmentAdapter />`
 * line made the same link open the settlement screen. With the `rudi://` scheme
 * that is every invite, share and push-notification link in the product.
 *
 * ## The rule now
 *
 * Exactly one thing changes: a URL that ALREADY NAMES A ROUTE is left alone,
 * because the router has already honoured it. Everything else the old code did
 * is kept, and the reason is a measurement rather than a preference.
 *
 * The first version of this file also dropped the `?? "/welcome"` fallback, on
 * the reasoning that `app/index.tsx` redirects a pathless entry to `/welcome`
 * anyway. On the emulator that turned out to be false: a `console.log` in
 * `IndexRoute` never fired, and a pathless cold start landed on the Khám phá
 * tab. expo-router does not route `exp://localhost:8095` through `/` at all, so
 * the unconditional redirect was the ONLY thing putting anybody on the welcome
 * screen. Twelve Maestro flows went red at once and said so.
 *
 * That is the shape of finding a web-target gate cannot produce, and it is the
 * reason the fallback is spelled out here instead of being inferred from the
 * route tree.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function of the URL string so it can be tested without a
 * device, a router, or a frame of render. The version that lived inside the
 * component could only be measured by driving an emulator.
