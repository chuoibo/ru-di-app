/** The `/bills` wire: a bill that outlives the screen showing it.
 *
 * Until now the assignment matrix existed only in React state. A person ticked
 * who ate what, `POST /expenses` split it, and the matrix itself was never
 * written anywhere -- so `suggested_item_keys`, `assignment_state` and the
 * whole `/bills` family sat unused on a server that had implemented them. Two
 * consequences, and the second is the one that matters: closing the app lost
 * the work, and nobody could reopen a bill to see who had claimed what.
 *
 * This module is the mapping, and only the mapping. No `fetch` lives here so
 * the money shapes can be tested without a server, which is the same reason
 * `assignment.ts` and `receipt.ts` are separate from `api.ts`.
 *
 * ## Money is integer dong, and this module refuses to pass on anything else
 *
 * Rule 1 of the three money rules bans `float` at every intermediate value,
 * not just at the edges. A `line_total_vnd` of `12000.5` reaching the server is
 * a 422 that says nothing useful; the same value reaching a total is a number
 * on screen nobody can reproduce. `nguyenDong` throws at the boundary instead,
 * where the field name is still known.
