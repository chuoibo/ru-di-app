// flow -- with no error and no navigation. Only the *notification* is silenced:
// uncaught errors still open LogBox full-screen, and warnings still reach the

/*
 * Direction contract v2 (Impeccable Flow A, code-led; RN has no HTML, so the
 * root layout carries it). Seed c8e88116, assigned index 6 of the grounded list.
 * THESIS  -- A travel journal the whole group writes in one evening: cover for
 *            the invitation, pages for the work; it refuses the category default
 *            of sunset photo + white cards + coral pill.
 * OWN-WORLD -- Indigo cloth cover (Persuade surfaces, story headers), bright
 *            paper pages (Operate surfaces), three saturated washi tapes with
 *            meaning (orange = the ask, teal = money, violet = AI) laid only on
 *            the region that matters now; status is an ink stamp, photos are
 *            Instax frames with their provenance line, plans are one continuous
 *            ink route; keylines print first, colour arrives with data; a 4pt
 *            grid snapped to whole units. Display: Bricolage Grotesque; body:
 *            system. Wordmark: Baloo 2 ExtraBold outlines, leaning 9 degrees.
 * STORY   -- Open the cover -> Rủ Đi thôi! -> discover a place -> plan it in
 *            chat -> go -> photograph the bill -> everyone sees their own share
 *            stamped, never a number the screen invented -> the night becomes
 *            a page in the album.
 * FIRST VIEWPORT -- Welcome is the closed cover: indigo full-bleed, wordmark
 *            very large in the upper third, one diagonal orange washi strip
 *            carrying "AI đi chơi, chia bill thông minh", the CTA
 *            "Rủ Đi thôi!" as a large stamp at the bottom; pressing it opens
 *            the cover onto the bright Login page.
 * FORM    -- expo-router stack + 4 tabs + create sheet; 48dp targets, 12sp
 *            floor, tabular money; motion instant 100 / standard 200 /
 *            shared 300 / celebrate 550 once per event, Reduce Motion to zero.
 *            Signature interaction: the cover opening, and a stamp landing when
 *            a state becomes true.
 * FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the
 *         finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster
 *         carrying its provenance
