/* The tail of the hero path, which nothing covered.
 *
 * `vertical-slice.test.mjs` walks an expense as far as the guest page. The
 * product's last step is a different one and lives on a different route:
 * "Cá nhân thấy tài chính cập nhật" -- `App.tsx` reads
 * `docSoDu(CONTEXT_ID, ...)`, i.e. `GET /contexts/{id}/balances`. No test in
 * this repo had ever called that route through the client, so the fact that
 * it answers 403 for the group the app actually uses was invisible: the
 * vertical slice stops before it, and every unit test around balances runs
 * against a fake.
 *
 * Measured on main@bf3c757 against a live API:
 *
 *     GET /contexts/1aa00000-…-0000a0000001/balances -> 403 permission_denied
 *                                                       {"detail":"is_group_member"}
 *     GET /contexts/<a group the actor is in>/balances -> 200 {"balances":[…]}
 *
 * The refusal is correct server behaviour -- `get_context_balances` checks
 * `repository.is_member`, which reads the database rather than trusting the
 * caller's own `X-Actor-Contexts` header. What is wrong is the id the app
 * hands it: `CONTEXT_ID` has never had a row in `contexts`.
 *
 * Why this needs its own test rather than one more assertion in the slice:
 * the two failures have different causes and different owners. The slice
 * fails at `confirm` (`participant_not_in_context`); this fails at
 * `balances` (`permission_denied`). Fixing the expense flow alone turns the
 * slice green and leaves this red, and that is exactly the outcome this file
 * exists to make visible instead of silent.
 *
 * Silent is not a figure of speech. `App.tsx` reads the balance under
 * `.catch(() => setSoDu(null))` -- no error surface, no retry, no message.
 * On screen the group's finances simply do not appear, which reads as "we
 * have not spent anything yet" rather than as a failure.
 *
 * Needs a live server, same convention as the slice: `MOBILE_REQUIRE_E2E=1`
 * turns a missing server into a failure.
