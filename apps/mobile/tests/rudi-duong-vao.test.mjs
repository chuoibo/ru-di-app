/* What a cold-start URL is allowed to make the app do.
 *
 * The defect: on Expo Go 57 / SDK 57 every deep link into an inner route
 * landed on the welcome screen. Measured 4 times out of 4 with
 * `exp://localhost:8095/--/settlements/team-da-lat`, and an A/B that removed
 * one line from `app/_layout.tsx` made the same link open the settlement
 * screen. With the shipping `rudi://` scheme that is every invite, share and
 * push-notification link.
 *
 * The cause was a synchronous guard in front of an asynchronous redirect, so
 * no assertion about the router could have caught it -- the router was doing
 * the right thing and being overwritten a frame later. What IS assertable is
 * the decision itself, once it stops living inside a `useEffect`. That is what
 * `diemVaoTuUrl` is and what this file gates.
 *
 * The first test is the one that keeps the rest honest: it is the exact URL
 * from the reproduction, and it must come back `giu-nguyen`.
