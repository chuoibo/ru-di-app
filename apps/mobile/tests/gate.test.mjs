/* What `npm test` actually runs.
 *
 * This file exists because the gate ran nothing at all and said so in a way
 * nobody read. `package.json` invoked `node --test tests/`, and a directory is
 * not a file the runner will load: every run ended with
 *
 *     Error: Cannot find module '.../apps/mobile/tests'
 *     # tests 1  # pass 0  # fail 1
 *
 * -- one failing "test" named `tests`, zero real tests executed, exit 1. Both
 * `test` and `test:e2e` were shaped that way, so the end-to-end run cited as
 * proof that the app talks to the real API had never executed either. A broken
 * runner invocation is worse than a failing test: a failing test names what is
 * wrong, while this one names a module path and looks like a local glitch.
 *
 * So the invocation is now itself under test. Two things are asserted, and the
 * second is the one that matters:
 *
 *   1. Every pattern either gate passes to `node --test` resolves to at least
 *      one real test file -- which is exactly what `tests/` failed.
 *   2. The union of *both* gates covers every `*.test.mjs` under `tests/`.
 *      Adding a test file that no gate reaches is the silent version of the
 *      same failure: the suite stays green while a file nobody runs rots.
 *
 * Why the union of both rather than `npm test` alone. `tests/e2e/` needs a
 * live server and a database only it can seed, so folding it into `npm test`
 * makes the everyday gate depend on whether something happens to be listening
 * on the API port. That was measured, not guessed: four consecutive runs of
 * identical code over a port another worktree was cycling gave 2 failures,
 * then 1, then 1, then 0. A gate whose answer changes without the code
 * changing is worse than one that skips honestly. So `npm test` stays
 * hermetic, `npm run test:e2e` owns the slice, `MOBILE_REQUIRE_E2E=1` is how
 * anyone claiming the app runs against a real API proves it -- and this test
 * keeps the split from turning into a hole, because a file reached by neither
 * gate still fails here.
 *
 * Deliberately not asserted: that the patterns are any particular string. The
 * requirement is that the gates reach the files, not that they spell them a
 * blessed way.

 * and nothing else, so the moment the gate moved to
 * `$(find tests -name '*.test.mjs')` the model read `$(find` as a filename,

 * it would have blocked the very repair it exists to protect.
