/* A headless Chrome, driven over a pipe, with no dependencies.
 *
 * Not a test file. `tests/*.test.mjs` is what the gate runs; this is the
 * helper those files import.
 *
 * Three of the shell's defects are things only a browser can see: how wide the
 * document scrolls, which ARIA attributes react-native-web actually emits, and
 * where the Tab key goes. `tsc` sees none of it and `expo export` succeeding
 * says only that a bundle was written. So there has to be a real render in the
 * loop, and the question is what drives it.
 *
 * Not puppeteer or playwright: neither is a dependency of this app, both pull
 * a browser download into `npm ci`, and adding ~300 MB to the mobile CI job to
 * assert three numbers is a bad trade. What is actually needed is small.
 * Chrome speaks the DevTools Protocol over a plain pipe -- `--remote-debugging-pipe`,
 * newline-free JSON delimited by NUL on fd 3 and fd 4 -- which needs nothing
 * but `child_process`. That also keeps this runnable on Node 20, which is what
 * CI pins; the WebSocket transport would have needed Node 22's global
 * `WebSocket` and would have passed locally and died in CI.
 *
 * The page is served from an ephemeral port (`listen(0)`), which is not a
 * detail. A fixed port is how a gate ends up measuring some other worktree's
 * dev server and reporting on a page this commit never built.
