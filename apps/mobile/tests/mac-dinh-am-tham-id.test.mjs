/* No display value may fall back to a raw machine id.
 *
 * bug-050923 was patched four times. Each patch was found by looking at the
 * screen that had just been caught, and each time a fifth site turned up
 * somewhere else: the debt panel, then the payment screen's "Người chuyển"
 * chip, then `ChiaSe` and the share message, then two private helpers inside
 * `api.ts` that no screen could see. Lead's reading of the third repeat is the
 * one this file acts on: when the same defect surfaces a third time the
 * question stops being "how many are left" and becomes "what MINTS them".
 *
 * What mints them is a single expression shape. Every one of the sites ended
 * the same way:
 *
 *     roster.find((p) => p.id === id)?.name ?? id
 *
 * A lookup, and then the id itself as the fallback. It reads like a safe
 * default because the expression always produces a string, and that is exactly
 * the failure: when the lookup misses, the app does not say "I cannot name this
 * person", it prints the database key and lets it pass for a name. On a money
 * row, beside real names, in the sentence copied to somebody's clipboard.
 *
 * So this gate does not enumerate screens and it does not enumerate function
 * names. Both of those questions have already been asked and both answered
 * "clean" while a site was open -- `labelFor` call sites could never reach
 * `nameOf`/`nameFrom`, because those are private. It asks about the SHAPE, over
 * every source file the app has, so a helper written tomorrow inside a closure
 * is in scope the day it is written.
 *
 * The shape, precisely: a `??` or `||` whose fallback branch is an id-bearing
 * expression, or a ternary with an id-bearing branch. Ternaries are included
 * deliberately. A gate that reads `??` and `||` only is blind to `x ? x : id`,
 * which is the same default written differently, and "the gate did not know
 * that spelling" is not a defence anyone can act on.
 *
 * THREE CONTROLS, because a source-scanning gate dies silently. A changed
 * glob, a parse that throws into a catch, a node kind that stopped matching:
 * all three report zero findings, which is indistinguishable from clean.
 *
 *   1. A fixture carrying the shape three ways and two safe fallbacks. The
 *      walker must return exactly the three.
 *   2. The REAL defect: the whole pre-fix `api.ts`, byte for byte, checked in
 *      beside this file. The gate has to go red on it at the two lines the bug
 *      was actually filed about. A regression gate that cannot redden on the
 *      original proves nothing about the copy of the bug it was written
 *      against.
 *   3. Floors on files read and expressions examined, so a walk that read
 *      nothing cannot pass as a tree with nothing in it.
 *
 * The allowlist below is ids used AS ids -- selection state, navigation
 * arguments, a toggle comparing a row to the open row. None of them reach a
 * person's eyes. Entries are keyed by file plus the expression text rather than
 * by line, so editing a file above them does not silently re-bless a line, and
 * a NEW expression in an already-listed file still trips.

 * The red control's material, and why it is a checked-in file rather than a
 * `git show`.
 *
 * The first version of this control ran `git show 0c04cb7:apps/mobile/src/
 * api.ts`. It went red on CI, and the red was correct behaviour by a control
 * written to fail hard rather than skip -- but what it had caught was its own
 * hidden dependency, not a defect. CI checks out shallow (`fetch-depth: 1`),
 * so the object is simply not in the clone:
 *
 *     not ok - phép quét ĐỎ được trên chính bản mã trước khi bug-050923...
 *       fatal: invalid object name "0c04cb7"
 *
 * Two separate things were wrong with reading history from a test. Clone depth
 * is one. The other is worse: this repo squash-merges, so any branch sha can
 * stop existing at all, and a control pinned to one would then be unrunnable
 * everywhere rather than only on CI. A negative control needs the old CONTENT.
 * It never needed the old COMMIT.
 *
 * So the content lives here, and provenance is kept by content-addressing
 * instead of by history. `OID_TRUOC_KHI_VA` is the git blob object id, and the
 * test below recomputes it from the bytes on disk -- sha1 over the `blob
 * <len>\0` header plus the content, which is what `git hash-object` does. Two
 * consequences worth stating:
 *
 *   - With no history whatsoever, `git hash-object <fixture>` reproduces this
 *     value, so an edited fixture cannot pass quietly.
 *   - With full history, `git rev-parse 0c04cb7:apps/mobile/src/api.ts` yields
 *     the same value, which is what ties the file to the commit it came from.
 *
 * Why a sibling file and not a template literal in this test: the blob holds
 * 298 backticks and 52 `${`. Inlining it means escaping it, and an escaped
 * copy is no longer the bytes the commit had -- which destroys precisely the
 * property the control exists for.
 *
 * The file is deliberately `.txt`. As `.ts` it would enter `tsc --noEmit` and
 * the tree walkers, and a stale copy of `api.ts` type-checked beside the real
 * one is the "two functions with the same name" failure this repo has already
 * paid for once. Note for anyone grepping later: this file is SUPPOSED to
 * contain `?? id`. It is the disease sample, not an outbreak.
