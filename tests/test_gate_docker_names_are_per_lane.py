"""The docker gate must judge THIS tree's image, not whichever tree tagged last.

## What went wrong

`scripts/gate.sh docker` built `mobile-api:gate` and ran `mobile-api-gate`.
Both names are global on a Docker daemon, and this machine runs five worktrees
of one repository against one daemon.

Measured 2026-08-30 (QA lane, #291). The reporter had merged #288 into their
tree, so their `services/api/app/api/routes/memories.py` line 18 read
`from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, Query, Response, status`. The stage
was red anyway, at that file, with the assertion #288 removed. Opening the
image the stage had just "built" showed a different source:

    $ docker run --rm mobile-api:gate grep -n "^from fastapi import" \\
          /srv/app/api/routes/memories.py
    18:from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, Query, status

That is another worktree's file. A second lane had run the same stage in
between, and `docker build -t mobile-api:gate` moved the tag out from under
the first. The same log carried two `No such container: mobile-api-gate`
lines -- the other lane's `docker rm -f` deleting a container mid-poll.

## Why this is worse than the red it produced

A false red is loud. The same collision in the other direction is silent: lane
A builds a tree that boots, lane B reads that image and concludes ITS tree
boots. Nothing in the stage's output distinguishes the two, and on 2026-08-30
the Lead adopted the rule "a PR that changes a route declaration does not merge
until the docker stage is green". That rule rests entirely on this stage
answering about the tree in front of it.

## How this file measures it

`docker` on PATH is replaced by a stub that records its argv and exits 0. That
makes the stage run in milliseconds and, more to the point, makes the question
answerable at all: what is being asserted is not what Docker did, it is which
NAMES the stage asked Docker for. Two lanes that never utter the same name
cannot take each other's artifact, whatever the daemon does with them.

Lane B is a copy of `scripts/` plus the two files the stage reads, in a temp
directory, because `gate.sh` locates the tree from its own path. That is the
reported failure exactly: two checkouts, one daemon.

## What this proves and what it does not

It proves the stage addresses image tags and container names that no second
checkout and no second run of this checkout can also address, and that a run
still reuses one tag across its own stages so the pinned-import stage keeps
hitting the build cache the docker stage filled.

It does not prove the build context is right, that the image is the tree, or
that Docker isolates two differently-named images -- that last one is a
property of Docker, not of this repository. It also cannot see a collision
introduced by something other than a name, an env var both lanes read, say,
or a shared bind mount.
