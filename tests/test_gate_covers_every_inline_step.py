"""Every inline workflow step must be accounted for on a laptop.

## The hole this closes

Two meta-gates already stand here, and each names the piece it cannot reach.

`test_workflow_gates_have_local_callers.py` (#148) makes every gate that is a
*script* have a caller outside the workflows. Its own last paragraph:

    "It also says nothing about workflow steps written inline rather than as a
     script. Those cannot be detected this way."

`test_gate_covers_every_workflow_job.py` answers that at the granularity of a
*job*: every job in the workflows has a named stage in `scripts/gate.sh`. That
is the right claim for a job appearing or disappearing, and it is blind to
everything inside one. The `api` job is mapped, so the `api` job is covered --
and a thirty-line inline step added to it tomorrow inherits that coverage
without anybody running it anywhere.

This file is that granularity. Every step in every workflow that runs shell is
listed below with what it is and where it runs locally. Add a step and this
fails on the commit that adds it.

## Why it matters more than it looks

GitHub Actions stopped starting jobs at 07:45Z on 2026-08-29 -- every run since
ends in seconds with "The job was not started because recent account payments
have failed". Re-measured 2026-08-30T00:5xZ: the last 300 runs are 300
failures and 0 successes, and the annotation on the newest one still says
billing. So `scripts/gate.sh` is not a convenience that mirrors CI. It is the
only place these commands run at all. A step that drifts out of it does not
degrade to "checked later" -- it stops being checked by anything.

Writing the table found one already: `test.yml`'s lint job asserts a `ruff==`
pin exists in services/api/requirements-dev.txt and exits 1 when it does not,
and nothing outside that dead workflow looked at the pin -- `ruff_changed.sh`
only checks a ruff is on PATH, and no test greps `ruff==`. `do_ruff` in
scripts/gate.sh now checks it.

## What this proves and what it does not

It proves each inline step is *classified* and, when it is a gate, that it
names a stage `scripts/gate.sh` actually has. It does not prove the stage runs
the same shell -- a bash function and a YAML block are not comparable by any
check worth trusting, and nobody can run the YAML to compare while Actions is
down.

`body_sha` narrows that gap without pretending to close it. It pins the text
each entry was reviewed against, so editing a step's commands fails here and
the reviewer is asked whether the local stage still does the same thing. It is
the repo guard's allowlist idea -- pin the bytes, re-review on change -- and it
catches drift only in the direction of the workflow moving first.

`kind` is where the review is recorded, and `SETUP`/`INFO` are the entries a
reviewer should read hardest, because they are the ones claiming a step needs
no local runner. `test_nothing_that_asserts_is_filed_as_setup_or_info` keeps
that from becoming a place to hide a gate.
