"""Every job in the workflows must be reachable from `scripts/gate.sh`.

## Why

`test_workflow_gates_have_local_callers.py` (#148) closed half of the problem
that GitHub Actions dying exposed: a gate that is a *script* must have a caller
outside the workflows. It names the half it cannot close, in its own words:

    "It also says nothing about workflow steps written inline rather than as a
     script. Those cannot be detected this way; the offline DDL render in the
     `api` job is one such step, and it is covered locally by
     services/api/tests/db/test_migration_matches_models.py, by hand and by
     luck."

By hand and by luck is the part this file replaces. `scripts/gate.sh` runs the
inline steps too -- the offline DDL render, the image running as non-root, the
container answering /healthz, the native bundle, and the environment variable
that turns three accessibility checks from decoration into a gate. This test
holds the line that it keeps doing so: add a job to a workflow and this fails on
the commit that adds it, rather than the next time somebody wonders whether the
local gate still means anything.

## What this proves and what it does not

It proves each workflow job has a *named stage* in the local gate. It does not
prove the stage runs the same commands the job runs -- nobody can prove that
while Actions cannot execute, and a shell script and a YAML job are not
comparable by any check worth trusting. The claim is deliberately the weak one,
for the same reason #148 gives: the failure being guarded against is total
absence, not weak equivalence.

Drift between the two remains possible and is a thing a reviewer has to look
for. `COVERED_BY` is where that review is recorded.

# `lint` maps to `ruff` and not to a stage of its own name because the local
# form is strictly wider: CI can only diff pushed commits, while the gate's
# one-argument call to ruff_changed.sh compares the merge base against the
# working tree, so it also sees changes that are not committed yet.
#
# `api` maps to three stages: the job runs the test suite AND two inline
# checks that need Python and nothing else -- `alembic upgrade head --sql`, and
# the client/API route check. The gate splits them so a migration that cannot
# compile is not reported as "the test suite failed".
#
# `contract` and `client-routes` are two stages and not one on purpose. They
# read the same two files and answer different questions: `contract` asks
# whether a call sends X-Actor-ID, `client-routes` asks whether the path it
# calls exists at all. Folding them together is not a tidy-up -- it is how one
# of them stops running, which is exactly what happened when both were briefly
# named `contract` (see tests/test_gate_stage_bodies_are_unique.py).
#
# `repo-guard` maps to two stages because the job runs two scans that answer
# different questions. `tree HEAD` asks what the branch is delivering;
# `range base..head` asks what it ever committed. A secret added and then
# deleted a commit later is invisible to the first and caught by the second,
# so folding them into one stage would silently drop the only check that sees
# it -- see tests/test_gate_guard_range_stage.py, which holds that line.
