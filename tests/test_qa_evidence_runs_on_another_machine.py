"""QA evidence that claims to be reproducible must reproduce somewhere else.

Every verdict under `docs/archive/claude/` points at a script in `tests/qa/` and invites
the reader to re-run it. The repository is public now, so "the reader" is no
longer only the four processes on this laptop.

## The measurement that produced this file

Run on 2026-08-30 against `origin/main` at 03b69dc: of the files tracked under
`tests/qa/`, **17 named an absolute path into one particular user's home
directory**. Three separate shapes, three separate failure modes:

    import puppeteer from "file:///home/lakiet/.claude/node_modules/..."   (7 files)
        ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND at load, before any assertion runs. No override,
        no fallback, nothing to read but a stack trace.

    const CHROME = process.env.X ?? "/home/lakiet/.cache/ms-playwright/..."  (9 files)
        Degrades if the env var is set, dies confusingly if it is not. Three
        different build numbers are hard-coded across the tree (1187, 1194,
        1234) because three different days installed three different browsers,
        which is the tell that nobody could have chosen this on purpose.

    createRequire("/home/lakiet/agent-harness/wt/qa/tests/qa/rd-qa-02/...")  (5 files)
        Points into a *sibling lane's worktree*. Broken on this machine too, the
        moment that worktree is re-created somewhere else.

## What this checks, and what it deliberately does not

It checks one property: no file tracked under `tests/qa/` contains a string
naming an absolute path inside a user's home directory. That is a shape check on
text. It is not a proof that the scripts run.

It does **not** prove: that puppeteer-core resolves, that a browser is installed,
that the servers those scripts drive are up, or that the evidence they once
produced would be produced again. It proves only that the reason they cannot run
elsewhere is no longer *this* reason. `npm ci`, `timTrinhDuyet()` and the harness
READMEs answer the rest.

It also did not prove the scripts *load*, and on 2026-08-31 that cost the repo
its closest-to-the-user gate. `make hero-walk` reported 0/16 stages for a whole
evening because PR #397 split `translated` into `translatedAsActor` /
`translatedAnonymous` and `qa-tt-0031/di-bo-hero-tren-demo.mjs` kept importing
the dead name. ESM refuses the whole module at LINK time, before a single line
runs, so the walk died at import with nothing to read -- and "0/16" looks far
more like "nobody ran it" than like "it is broken".

`test_moi_nhap_noi_bo_deu_ton_tai` below closes that. It is a link check, not a
run: for every first-party import under `tests/qa/`, the target file must exist
and must actually export every name the script asks for. Running the scripts is
still not an option -- they launch browsers, drive live servers and spend model
quota -- and the two questions are genuinely different, so the limit is written
into that test rather than blurred here.

`test_moi_ten_duoc_dung_deu_co_duong_nhap` covers the adjacent shape: a name
*used* but never imported, which is a ReferenceError at run time rather than a
SyntaxError at link time and so is invisible to the link check.

Scope is `tests/qa/` because that is what the QA lane owns. `apps/mobile/` has
its own equivalent, `tests/nhap-khau-chay-duoc-may-khac.test.mjs`: #326 closed
the import specifiers there and #329 closed the browser-binary constants, so the
three remaining mentions of a home directory under `apps/mobile/` are prose in
banners describing the old defect, not live paths. Two gates rather than one
widened across both trees, because each lane can only fix its own side and a
gate nobody can act on is a gate people learn to route around.
