"""Suite-wide default for the repo-root tests: the header adapter, unless asked.

The twin of `services/api/tests/conftest.py`, and the reason there are two.

`scripts/postgres_tier.sh` runs the live tier as **two pytest processes**, both
invoked from `services/api`: one over `tests/postgres`, one over `../../tests/qa`.
The second collects nothing under `services/api/tests`, so the conftest there
never imports, and the sixteen live QA cases that authenticate with `X-Actor-*`
met the `prod` default and answered 401 -- twenty-two of them, measured in CI on
2026-09-03 and reproduced locally with the same command.

That is the failure mode of this mechanism, and it is worth naming: an
invocation nobody thought of gets `prod` and goes **red**. Loud rather than
silent, which is the right direction for a default that exists to fail closed --
but it does mean a third test root added later needs a third line like this one.

`setdefault`, not assignment: exporting `MOBILE_AUTH_MODE=prod` before pytest
still wins, which is how you run these suites against the strict adapter on
purpose.
