"""The demo machine must carry a dataset somebody can actually demo.

## Why this is a third gate and not a flag on the second one

`check_demo_matches_main.py` asks "does the demo serve the routes main
declares". It says so itself, in its own "what it does NOT prove" section:

    - It says nothing about the database.

That sentence was accurate and it was load-bearing. Measured on this machine on
2026-08-30, both gates green, ten minutes apart, for six hours:

    $ make demo-check URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099
    Route máy demo: 76 phục vụ / 76 origin/main khai — KHỚP
    exit 0

    $ docker exec mobile-local-postgres-1 psql -U mobile -d mobile -At -c \
        "SELECT count(*) FROM outings"
    0

Zero outings. F13 (tạo buổi đi), F14 (mời), F15 (đóng thời gian) and F16 (AI lên
kế hoạch) are finished and their tests are green, and all four render EMPTY on
the demo machine, because every screen that shows them reads from a table with
nothing in it. The album route answers 200 with an empty list, so it is not even
an error anybody would notice.

Every signal on the machine said the demo was fine. The route gate was right and
useless: it compared paths, and the paths were perfect.

## What it checks

That the demo group is fully built, against expectations **imported from
`seed_demo_data.py`** rather than copied into this file. A hand-written "expect
3 outings" here would not know when the script starts building four, and would
go on passing while the demo lost a trip. So the numbers come from the same
`outings()` and `PEOPLE` the builder itself uses.

Checked, and each one is something a human would SEE on the demo:

    outings      == len(outings())    Khám phá / kỷ niệm / album are empty without it
    batches      == len(outings())    the collection rounds behind the money screens
    members      == len(PEOPLE)       a split among two people is not the demo
    expenses     == sum of the specs  the ledger the whole hero path reads from

## Why counts, and why equality rather than "at least"

`>= 1` would pass the state this gate was written for. The demo group on
2026-08-30 had EIGHT collection rounds where the script declares three: several
runs stacked on top of each other, one of them dead partway. That is not a
dataset anybody designed, and "at least one" calls it healthy. Too many rounds
is as wrong as too few -- it means a rerun landed on top of a previous one, and
the money screens show a history nobody scripted.

## Why it does not check the memory wall

Because `seed_demo_data.py` does not build one. Asserting `memories > 0` here
would make this gate fail forever on a correctly seeded machine, and a gate that
is red when the thing it guards is right gets switched off within a day. The
memory wall being empty is a real gap in the demo, but it is a gap in the
BUILDER, and the honest place to say so is here in prose, not as a red line in a
checker that would be lying about which component is broken.

## What it does NOT prove

- Nothing here renders a screen. Rows in `outings` do not prove the Khám phá
  screen draws them; it proves the screen has something to draw. `imp detect`
  and the hero-path walk remain the only things that speak for the UI.
- It reads counts, not content. Three outings with empty titles pass.
- It says nothing about the OTHER groups on a shared demo database. The machine
  also carries probe data from several lanes; this gate is scoped to the one
  group the demo script builds, on purpose, because the rest is not demoed.
- A dataset that is correct now can be wrong ten minutes from now. That is what
  running it on a schedule is for, not what one green run means.

Usage:
  scripts/check_demo_data.py
  scripts/check_demo_data.py --dsn postgresql://mobile:...@127.0.0.1:5439/mobile
  scripts/check_demo_data.py --json

Exit codes: 0 the demo dataset is complete,
1 the dataset is incomplete or overbuilt -- the demo will show the wrong thing,
2 the check could not run -- and could not run is never a pass.
