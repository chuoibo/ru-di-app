"""Let `seed_demo_data.py` build its group a SECOND time on a database that already ran it.

The problem this exists for
---------------------------
`seed_demo_data.py` derives every write key from a fixed namespace and a fixed
slug -- `uuid5(DEMO_NAMESPACE, "write:" + slug)`. Nothing in the key varies per
run or per context. That is deliberate and it is right for the case it was
written for: a half-finished run re-runs and replays the writes that landed
instead of doubling them.

It has a consequence nobody wrote down until 2026-08-30. The expenses are
backdated from `datetime.now(UTC)`, so their request bodies move with the
calendar. Re-running on a later day therefore sends *the same key* with *a
different body*, and the server does exactly what it should:

    POST /expenses -> HTTP 422 {"code": "idempotency_key_reuse"}

So the fixture can only ever build its group ONCE per database. After that the
demo data is frozen in whatever shape it reached, correct or not.

Why the documented recovery was not usable
------------------------------------------
`check_complete()` offers two ways out, and on the machine that needed them
both were worse than the disease:

  1. "build a separate stack, separate database" -- works, but it is a second
     demo machine at a second address, and the address everyone's link, cron
     entry and phone points at is still serving the broken data.
  2. "`make clean` then `make demo`" -- `make clean` removes TWO volumes, and
     the second one is `mobile-media-data`. Every uploaded photo on the machine
     goes with it, and the Makefile says plainly that seeding does not bring
     them back: "seed dựng dữ liệu tiền, không dựng ảnh của người ta."

The message also says, correctly, that the group cannot be deleted with SQL --
`confirmed_allocations` and nine sibling tables carry BEFORE DELETE OR UPDATE
triggers that reject the row. That is the ledger doing its job and this script
does not argue with it.

The third way
-------------
Nothing requires the old group to be DELETED. It only has to stop answering to
the name the fixture looks up, because both `seed_demo_data.existing_group()`
and `check_demo_data.py` resolve the demo group by

    SELECT id FROM contexts WHERE display_name = %s LIMIT 1

`contexts` carries no immutability trigger -- it holds no material fact -- so
renaming it is a plain UPDATE. Rename the old group, drop the fixture's own
replay keys, and the next `make demo` builds a genuinely new group beside the
old one. Nothing is deleted. The ledger keeps every row it ever had, which is
what an append-only ledger is FOR, and invariant 3 still holds: balances remain
recomputable from the ledger for both groups.

What this script will not do
----------------------------
It deletes from exactly one table, `idempotency_keys`, and only the rows whose
key it can regenerate from the fixture's own namespace. On the machine this was
written for that was 29 rows out of 879 -- the other 850 belong to other lanes
and are never candidates, because a key that this script cannot derive is a key
it does not own. `IMMUTABLE_TABLES` below is asserted against, not remembered.

Which database it opens
-----------------------
`--dsn`, else `MOBILE_DATABASE_URL`, else the local stack. The middle one was
missing until 2026-08-31 and cost a real incident: a lane pointed the variable
at its own throwaway stack, ran with `--yes`, and this script renamed the demo
group on the SHARED database at 5432 instead. Every other component reads that
variable -- `seed_demo_data.py`, `app/db/session.py`, `app/db/migrations/env.py`,
`e2e_slice.sh` -- so setting it and being ignored is the one outcome nobody
checks for. Nothing was printed either, so the only trace was a key count that
looks reasonable right up until you notice it counted somebody else's keys.

Both halves are fixed: the variable is read, and the target is printed before
anything is opened, so a wrong one is visible on a dry run.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/reset_demo_group.py                 # dry run, writes nothing
    python3 scripts/reset_demo_group.py --yes           # actually rename + clear
    python3 scripts/reset_demo_group.py --dsn ... --yes # another machine

Then `make demo` (or the `demo` compose service) to build the fresh group.
