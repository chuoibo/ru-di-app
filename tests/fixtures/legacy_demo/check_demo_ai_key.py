"""Does the AI key the RUNNING machine actually holds still work?

    scripts/check_demo_ai_key.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8099

## The failure this exists to catch

On 2026-08-30 the leader rotated `GEMINI_API_KEY` at 22:19:45. `.env` got the
new key immediately. The demo container on 8099 had started three hours
earlier, and a container reads its environment once, at startup -- so it went
on presenting a key that no longer existed.

Everything an operator would think to check stayed green. `/healthz` returned
200 (it does not touch the model, and by design does not touch the database
either). `/openapi.json` listed all 76 routes including the four of the photo
-> items join. `check_ai_key.sh` was silent, because it asks whether a key is
CONFIGURED and one was. The only broken thing was the hero path itself:

    POST /receipts/scan -> 502 {"code":"receipt_reader_unavailable"}

reproduced 3/3, in ~0.45s. That timing is the tell -- an upstream that rejects
you answers far faster than one that reads an image -- but nobody reads timings
on a machine that looks healthy.

## Why the existing checks could not see it

`check_ai_key.sh` compares against ABSENCE. It resolves the key the way Compose
would and warns when there is none. After a rotation there is a key in both
places; they are simply different keys, and "different" is invisible to a check
whose only question is "empty?".

`hero_walk.sh` does measure the real thing, end to end, through the real model.
But one walk costs a real Gemini call, so the cheap default stage asserts a
RECORDED verdict is recent rather than walking again. That is the right trade
and its own header says what it buys: a machine that broke five minutes ago
stays green until the verdict expires. On the day of the rotation the recorded
verdict was 33 minutes old and still passing, so the gate reported ĐẠT for a
hero path that had been dead for half an hour.

So the hole is specific: between two expensive walks, nothing asks whether the
machine can still reach the model. This fills exactly that hole, cheaply enough
to run every time -- the staleness comparison costs nothing at all, and the
liveness ping is a five-token prompt rather than an image.

## What it proves, and what it refuses to claim

Proves, about the machine at `--base-url`:

  - a key is configured for Compose, and the running container has one
  - the container's key is the SAME key `.env` now holds  (catches rotation)
  - that key is still accepted by the model API          (catches revocation,
                                                          and exhausted quota)

Refuses to claim:

  - that `POST /receipts/scan` returns items. A live key is necessary, not
    sufficient: the reader can still fail on prompt, parsing, or the image.
    Only `hero_walk.sh` answers that, and it costs a real read to do it.
  - anything about a machine other than the one on that port.
  - anything about the future. A key can die one second after this exits 0;
    that is why this is cheap enough to run again rather than to cache.

## Fail closed

A key never appears in output -- not the value, not a hash of it. Lengths and
MATCH/MISMATCH are enough to act on, and the repo rule is that a check reports
the NAME of a variable, never its content.

Exit codes, kept distinct because collapsing them is how "could not measure"
becomes "measured fine":

    0  the running machine can reach the model
    1  it cannot, and the reason is named
    2  could not be determined -- NOT a pass
