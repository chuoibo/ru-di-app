# Walk the whole hero path against a running box, INCLUDING the scan seam that
# no other gate crosses.
#
# ## The hole this closes
#
# The hero path the product is being built to demonstrate is
#
#     ảnh bill -> Gemini đọc món -> gán món -> chia tiền -> đợt thu -> trang khách
#
# and on 2026-08-30 at d4f6f91 it was proven by two pieces that do not touch:
#
#   - `apps/mobile/tests/e2e/duong-bill.test.mjs` is gated (the `e2e` stage runs
#     it on a stack it provisions) but starts at `toBill()` -- a `reading`
#     written by hand in the test file. It never calls `scanReceipt`. Its case
#     names mention bills, so reading the list suggests the photo step is
#     covered; `grep -n scanReceipt apps/mobile/tests/e2e/*.test.mjs` returns
#     nothing.
#   - `apps/mobile/tests/receipt.test.mjs` exercises `readingFromWire` fifteen
#     times, all of them against `LIVE_SCAN` -- a wire body captured from a
#     server on 2026-08-29 and frozen into the file. A server that changed its
#     response shape today leaves every one of them green.
#   - `services/api/tests/live/test_gemini_receipt.py` does read real images
#     with the real model, and stops there: it never posts the result to
#     `/bills`. It is also opt-in behind `MOBILE_LIVE_GEMINI=1`, and
#     `grep -rn MOBILE_LIVE_GEMINI` over the whole tree finds only that file --
#     no `scripts/`, no `.github/`. Nothing schedules it.
#
# So the joint -- `POST /receipts/scan` -> `readingFromWire()` -> `POST /bills`
# -- had no caller in any gate. That is the exact shape that broke this product
# twice: #235 and #247 each tightened an active-membership rule, the backend
# suite stayed green, the client suite stayed green, and the two together
# answered 422 to everybody. Two green halves do not add up to a path.
#
# `tests/qa/qa-tt-0031/di-bo-hero-tren-demo.mjs` does walk the joint, end to
# end, through the compiled client. Measured before this script existed:
#
#     grep -rn "di-bo-hero-tren-demo" Makefile scripts .github services
#     -> no match
#
# It ran when somebody remembered. This script is the caller it never had.
#
# ## What it proves, and what it does not
#
# Proves: on the box named by --url, a photograph reaches the model, the lines
# come back in the shape the assignment screen consumes, and that same reading
# survives all the way to a guest page and a confirmed receipt -- driven by
# `dist-test/api.js`, the same compiled client the screens import.
#
# Does NOT prove:
#   - anything about THIS branch's server. The client is rebuilt from this tree
#     (see below), the server is whatever is running on --url. That pairing is
#     the point when --url is the demo box, and it is why the run prints both
#     sides' provenance instead of one SHA.
#   - that the model reads any particular wording. Assertions are on shape and
#     on integer money, never on the model's strings; a test that pins "Lẩu
#     Thái" tests the model, not the product.
#   - CORS. `node`'s fetch does not enforce it, same blind spot as every other
#     gate here.
#   - anything about a second image. One bill, one reading, one run.
#   - that the tree being gated still walks. `--status` binds the verdict to an
#     ANCESTOR of HEAD, so commits added after the walk are covered by nothing.
#     It rules out borrowed evidence, not staleness within the branch.
#   - that anything git does not track holds the same bytes here as where the
#     walk ran. `tree` is built from `git status`, so gitignored paths are
#     outside it by construction. What IS checked is the PRESENCE of the
#     out-of-git artifacts the walk cannot start without (`ngoai_git`), so a
#     verdict can no longer be lent to a tree that has never run `npm ci`.
#     Their CONTENT is not: two trees whose `node_modules` were installed from
#     different lockfiles read alike here. Hashing them would mean hashing
#     `node_modules` on every gate run and putting a real `.env` into a digest,
#     which repo rules forbid outright -- so this is a boundary chosen with the
#     cost named, not a corner nobody looked at.
#   - that a walk measured over uncommitted edits says anything about a commit.
#     It no longer PRETENDS to: the verdict records the tree state next to the
#     sha, and `--status` refuses to lend a dirty walk to any other tree. What
#     it still cannot do is tell you which of your edits carried the green.
#
# ## Why it pins the URL instead of letting the client default
#
# `BASE_URL` in `src/api.ts` falls back to `http://localhost:8099`, which is the
# shared demo stack every worktree on this machine can reach. A gate that
# reached it by *default* would report a colour about code nobody can attribute.
# This script sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` explicitly and prints it, so the target
# is a decision on the record rather than a fallback.
#
# ## Why it rebuilds the client
#
# `dist-test/` is gitignored build output and can be older than `src/`. Walking
# with a stale `dist-test` measures a client that no longer exists in any tree
# -- the "bundle from a different SHA" mistake. The build here is the same one
# `npm run test:e2e` does.
#
# ## Why a run records a verdict, and why `--status` is the thing in the gate
#
# This walk costs a live Gemini call and about ten seconds. `make gate` runs
# dozens of times a day, so putting the live walk in the default list would
# either burn model quota all day or -- more likely -- get the stage deleted the
# first week. Leaving it OUT of the default list is worse: a gate nobody calls
# is decoration, which is the hole this file exists to close, reproduced.
#
# `scripts/demo_watch.py` already settled this shape here: run the expensive
# measurement on demand, RECORD the verdict, and have the cheap default stage
# assert the recording is recent and about the right target. A stale or missing
# verdict is red, so "nobody has walked the hero path today" is visible in every
# gate run instead of being nothing at all.
#
# "The right target" is two things, and the first cut of this file only checked
# one. `url` says which BOX was walked; `sha` says which CLIENT. The sha was
# recorded and printed on the pass line but compared to nothing, so a walk on
# any other branch -- or a sha this repo has never heard of -- vouched for
# whatever tree the gate stood in. With one verdict dir shared by every worktree
# on this machine, that is the ordinary case, not a contrived one. `--status`
# now requires the recorded sha to be an ANCESTOR of HEAD.
#
# Ancestor rather than equal on purpose: pinning to HEAD would spend a model
# call on every docs commit, and a stage that expensive gets deleted -- the
# outcome this whole section is arranged to avoid. So the check refuses a walk
# this tree does not contain, and does NOT claim the commits added since the
# walk keep the seam working. That weaker promise is written down below rather
# than left for a reader to assume the stronger one.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh                      walk the demo box on 8099
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh --url http://h:1234  another box
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh --anh /tmp/x/ro.jpg  another bill image
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh --status             what did the last walk say
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh --van-tay            what this runner thinks the
#                                             working tree is right now
#   scripts/hero_walk.sh --ngoai-git          what the walk needs that git does
#                                             not track, and whether it is here
#
# Exit: 0 walk green · 1 a precondition is genuinely absent · 2 something that
# should be here is missing or broken (refuse to skip), or the walk failed.

# The one question the recorded sha cannot answer: is the client that was walked
# the client that commit contains? `git rev-parse HEAD` prints the same string
# for a clean checkout and for that checkout plus edits living in no commit, and
# the verdict dir is shared by every worktree on this machine -- so a walk done
# over a local fix vouched for the broken commit underneath it, in every other
# lane's `make gate` too.
#
# Measured before this existed, on 69938b7: break the scan seam, COMMIT the
# break (e845ced), patch it back in the working tree only, walk. The walk is
# green 16/16 and records sha=e845ced. Restore the tree to the committed state
# and `--status` says "ĐI ĐƯỢC 16/16 chặng, client e845ced (nằm trong HEAD
# e845ced)", exit 0 -- while a real walk on that same clean tree exits 1, ĐỨT at
# the scan step. One field, two meanings, and the dangerous one silent.
#
# So the walk records WHICH TREE, not only which commit. `clean` keeps the cheap
# ancestor rule below untouched -- no clean walk changes behaviour. Anything else
# is code no commit contains, and may vouch only for the worktree that produced
# it, and only while that worktree still holds those exact edits.
#
# Untracked files count: a new .ts under apps/mobile/src is compiled into the
# client the walk drives, and `git diff HEAD` alone never sees it.

# for a tree nobody walked, which is verbatim what this block was added to stop:
