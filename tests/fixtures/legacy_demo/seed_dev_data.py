"""Fill a local development database with one synthetic collection round.

Runs inside the API image (see the `seed` service in docker-compose.yml): it
needs psycopg, which is a runtime dependency, and network access to the API.

There are two write paths on purpose.

* `people` are written with SQL. No HTTP route created them when this was
  written, and inventing product surface inside a dev fixture is worse than
  admitting the gap. (The account-registration block that used to sit beside
  it left with ADR-0015: the product no longer says where money moves.)
* Everything else goes through the real HTTP API. That is the point: a seed
  that finished means the vertical slice answered for real, not that a script
  can run INSERT.

Re-running is a no-op. The demo group is looked up by display name first, so
`make up` twice does not create a second group or a second expense.

All data here is invented. Nothing in this file may ever be replaced with a
real name, a real account number, or a real amount -- it is committed to Git.
