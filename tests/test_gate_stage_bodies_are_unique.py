"""No two gate stages may share a name, and no checker may go unreachable.

## Why

`scripts/gate.sh` dispatches a stage by calling `"do_$stage"`. That indirection
is what makes the gate extensible, and it is also what lets a stage die without
saying so.

On 2026-08-29 two branches added a stage named `contract` independently. #163
(actor headers) reached `main` first; #165 (client route existence) had been cut
before it, so on neither branch was there a collision to see. Merging them
produced this, and it is worth reading slowly because every step is silent:

  - `git merge` reported conflicts in `STAGES=` and `check_prereq` only. A
    reviewer resolves those two, sees a clean tree, and is done.
  - The two `do_contract()` bodies do not overlap textually, so git merged them
    *both* into the file with no marker between them.
  - `bash -n scripts/gate.sh` parses it. Two definitions of one function is
    legal shell.
  - Bash keeps the LAST definition. `stage_help`'s `case` keeps the FIRST.
  - So `./scripts/gate.sh contract` printed "every route wanting X-Actor-ID is
    called with it", ran the route-existence check instead, and exited 0.
  - The actor-header checker's two canaries never ran. 61 client calls went
    uncounted. `tests/test_gate_covers_every_workflow_job.py` stayed green,
    because `--list` still reported one stage named `contract` and every job
    still mapped to a stage that existed.

Reproduced end to end in `tests/qa/rd-qa-28/va-cham-ten-chang-contract.sh`.

## What this proves and what it does not

It proves the stage table and the stage bodies are a bijection, and that no
checker the script *invokes* has been orphaned behind a shadowed definition. It
does not prove a stage runs the right commands -- nothing here can, and
`test_gate_covers_every_workflow_job.py` says the same about its own claim. The
failure guarded against is a gate that stops running while still reporting.

The bodies are parsed out of the file rather than asked of bash, because bash
is exactly the component that resolves the collision silently: `declare -F`
after sourcing would report one `do_contract` and agree with the bug.
