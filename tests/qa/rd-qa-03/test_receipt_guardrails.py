"""Two guards the receipt reader does not have yet (rd-qa-03).

These are deterministic: no network, no model, no image. They call the pure
domain normalizer with readings shaped exactly like the ones the real Gemini
backend returned during the rd-qa-03 adversarial run, and assert the guard that
was missing in both cases.

Why this file skips on `main`: `app.domain.receipt` arrives with the Gemini
receipt reader, which is not merged yet. On `main` there is nothing to guard, so
the file skips. On the branch that carries the reader it is expected to be RED
until the guards land -- that redness IS the finding, not a broken test.

Evidence behind each case is in docs/archive/claude/2026-08-29/rd-qa-03-ai-co-bia-khong.md.
