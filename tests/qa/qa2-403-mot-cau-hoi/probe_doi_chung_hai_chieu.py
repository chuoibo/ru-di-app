"""Two-way control for the three 403s reported against F43 / F44 / F45.

The report `docs/archive/claude/2026-08-31/qa2-022247-con-thieu-gi-va-vi-sao.md` listed
three rows as TAC (blocked):

    F43  GET  403 /contexts/1aa00000-aaaa-4aaa-8aaa-0000a0000001/map
    F44  GET  403 /contexts/1aa00000-aaaa-4aaa-8aaa-0000a0000001/heatmap
    F45  POST 403 /contexts/1aa00000-aaaa-4aaa-8aaa-0000a0000001/meet

Same context id, same status. That shape has two readings, and they need
opposite fixes, so a report that does not separate them is worse than no
report:

  (a) The caller is not a member of that group. 403 is then CORRECT, the
      server is fine, and the probe pointed at the wrong group.
  (b) A real permission defect: a caller who IS a member is still refused.

One direction cannot tell them apart. A 403 alone is consistent with both.
This script therefore runs FOUR directions against one live stack:

    A  member  x  1aa00000-...   the reported call, reproduced
    B  member  x  real group     the control (a) predicts 200 for
    C  stranger x  real group    the positive control -- proves the gate
                                 bites, so a 200 in B is membership being
                                 honoured and not the gate being off
    D  GET /contexts/{id}        does the id name a group at all?

Direction C is not optional. Without it, "B answered 200" is equally well
explained by a gate that lets everyone through, and the conclusion would rest
on the assumption the run was supposed to test.

It also answers a question the Lead asked separately, because a 403 and a
200-with-zero-areas look the same from a screen that only renders the empty
state: on the real group, does GET /heatmap return areas, or an empty list?
Those need different fixes too -- permissions versus seed data.

Nothing here writes. POST /meet is documented as reading no history and
writing no row; every other call is a GET.
