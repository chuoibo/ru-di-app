"""Every write path in `service.py` that takes a person's identity from its caller.

The shape being audited, stated once: **proving the CALLER may act here says
nothing about the people the caller NAMES.** `_require_permission` answers the
first question. Only `_require_participants_are_members` answers the second, and
it is called from three places -- and being called is not the same as being
handed every id, which is how holes 1 and 2 below survived #235.

It has gone wrong twice, both times found after the merge:

* #235 -- `confirm_expense` took `proposal.participants` from the body. The
  three money rules in `CLAUDE.md` stayed green the whole time, because they are
  arithmetic and the arithmetic was right; only the people were wrong.
* #247 -- `PUT /bills/{id}/assignments` had the same hole on the route the demo
  actually walks. Two outsider UUIDs came back 200 with full amounts stored.

Both were found by grepping for the word `participants`, which is why this file
does not grep. The inventory below is derived from the schemas: every field in
`app/api/schemas.py` annotated `UUID` or `list[UUID]` that names a person, plus
every `person_id` path parameter, matched to the service method that writes it.

Each case answers the three questions this audit asks:

  1. Are the NAMED people checked -- not the caller?
  2. If not, what is written and who reads it?
  3. Is there a gate that goes red when the check is removed?

Every case now asserts the behaviour that should happen, with no `xfail` left in
the file. The three holes it opened were carried as `xfail(strict=True)` until
each was closed -- hole 3 by #260, holes 1 and 2 by `rd-be-26` -- and the
markers came out as the second half of those fixes, which is what strictness
was for: a repair that left one in place would turn XPASS into a red gate that
names itself.

A fourth was recorded here without a marker, because it was not failing:
`create_outing_invite` let `source="group"` assert membership that nothing
verified, and no screen redeemed a named invite yet, so the case asserted the
hole in order to name it. `rd-be-26` closed that one too, and the case now
asserts the refusal -- an audit case that documents a hole has the same second
half as a strict marker, it just fails louder if you forget.

Holes 1 and 2 were not closed by adding a second check. `confirm_expense`
already called the guard; it just handed it `participants` alone while
`paid_by_id` and `recorded_by_id` came from the same body. So `mutants.sh`
drops those two arguments one at a time rather than deleting the call, because
deleting the call only re-proves the gate #235 already installed.

    Measured on clean `main` at dbc1e35: `POST /bills` stored the outsider as a
    `bill_item_shares` row with `source="ai_suggested"`, and then
    `POST /bills/{id}/split` came back 422 `UNKNOWN_PARTICIPANT` -- because
    `split_bill` builds its participant list from the ACTIVE ROSTER and then
    asks the allocator to honour the stored shares.

    Confirming assignments does not clear it: `confirm_bill_assignments`
    deletes existing shares only for the item_keys the request names, so an
    item nobody re-assigns keeps its stranger share. Re-measured on the same
    tree -- after confirming the other item, split was still 422. The screen
    has no reason to re-touch an item that already looks assigned, so from the
    group's side the bill is simply stuck: scan -> assign -> split, the exact
    path the demo walks, dead with no way out inside the product.

    """`source="group"` claims provenance, and now something verifies it.

    This case recorded the fourth hole while it was still open: `source`
    asserts the invitee is in the group, and `create_outing_invite` read the
    field, wrote `invited_person_id`, and never asked. It was a *sleeping*
    hole -- no screen redeems a named invite into a grant yet -- which is the
    class of bug that stays harmless until the day a feature switches on. It
    was written down so that day would not start from scratch.

    `rd-be-26` closed it with the same guard the other three use, narrowed to
    the claim actually being made: only `source="group"` asserts membership,
    so only it is roster-checked. A `friend` invite still names somebody
    outside the group, because that is what inviting a friend means -- see
    `services/api/tests/postgres/test_outing_invite_source_must_match_roster.py`
    for the control that keeps the gate from swallowing the feature.

    The neighbouring case, a UUID naming nobody, reached
    `fk_outing_invites_person` and surfaced as a 500; it now answers with
    `_require_registered_person`, the same code `invite_context_member` gives.
