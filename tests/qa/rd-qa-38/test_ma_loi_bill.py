"""Why does the hero path answer "Không đọc được bill", and can anyone tell?

rd-qa-37 measured the same file reading back 6 times out of 11 and could not say
why. rd-be-20 (#209) then wired `sanitize_image` into `/receipts/scan` for a
privacy reason, and the hypothesis was that re-encoding had accidentally fixed
the reliability bug as a side effect.

rd-qa-38 measured it again on the same file and the hypothesis did not survive:
53.3% before the sanitiser and 56.7% after, n=30 each, in one process where the
sanitiser call is the only difference. What the measurement did find is a cause,
and it is not the picture. Across 12 real calls the reader emitted
`quantity_text: ""` -- an empty string, for lines that print no quantity -- 25
times, and 5 of those 12 readings carried at least one. `_read_quantity` treats
a missing key as "one of this item" and an empty string as a malformed quantity,
so one empty string on one line raises INVALID_QUANTITY for the WHOLE receipt.
The other four items are read correctly and thrown away with it.

That code then reaches `scan_receipt`, which has explicit branches for six codes
and one final catch-all for the rest. INVALID_QUANTITY lands in the catch-all,
becomes `422 receipt_unreadable`, and the person is told to check their photo --
about a photo the model read correctly.

Nothing is written down. The server logs one access line, `422 Unprocessable
Content`, which is the same line a malformed `X-Actor-ID` produces. So the one
failure that actually happens on the hero path is also the one nobody can
diagnose from a log.

Everything below is deterministic: the fake reader replays reading shapes
observed from the real model, so no network, no key, and no rate is involved.
The observed shapes are in `docs/archive/claude/2026-08-30/rd-qa-38-do-lai-do-tin-cay.md`.
