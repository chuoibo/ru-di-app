"""`make up` has to hand the AI credential to the container, or say it cannot.

Compose does not forward the host environment into a container. Only what a
service lists under ``environment:`` crosses that boundary. ``x-api-env``
listed ``MOBILE_DATABASE_URL`` and nothing else, so every stack built by
``make up`` -- including the shared ``mobile-local`` one the whole team calls --
ran the receipt reader with no key.

Nothing looked wrong. The API was up, ``/healthz`` answered 200, every screen
rendered. Only the hero feature was silently dead, and it failed in the one
shape that reads as the user's own fault (see
``services/api/tests/api/test_receipts_scan_unconfigured.py``).

Three independent things are pinned here, because fixing any one alone still
ships a demo that dies:

  1. the variable crosses into the container, and its value comes from the
     host rather than from a committed literal;
  2. a stack built without the key says so at build time, naming the variable,
     instead of letting the first bill photo discover it;
  3. the warning agrees with Compose about where a key may live. Compose reads
     the shell environment AND ``.env`` at the repo root; the check read only
     the first, so it called the documented setup -- the key in ``.env``, which
     is what ``.env.example`` and the warning's own advice instruct -- a
     missing key, while that key sat in the container working. A gate that
     fires on correct behaviour is a gate somebody switches off, and then it is
     not there on the day it would have been right.

The YAML cases parse the file directly so they gate on a machine with no
Docker. The Compose-backed cases check the one thing a parser cannot -- how
Compose itself interpolates -- and skip out loud when Docker is absent.

Every case controls the ``.env`` it is judged against, via a temporary repo
root for the script and ``--env-file`` for Compose. Cases that merely unset the
shell variable were asserting "no key anywhere" while leaving half of what is
read untouched, so they answered differently depending on whether the person
running them had configured a key -- green on a fresh clone, red for anyone who
had followed the instructions.
