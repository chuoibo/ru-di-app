"""The demo-data gate has to bite, and has to bite for the right reason.

These tests never touch a database. `psycopg.connect` is replaced with a fake
whose row counts the test chooses, so the cases below can describe a demo
machine in any state -- including states that would take half an hour to build
for real -- without going near the shared Postgres every lane is working on.

The one thing a fake cannot speak for is whether the gate reads a real machine
correctly, and that was measured by hand instead, both directions, recorded in
the pull request: red on the actual demo machine on 8099 (8 đợt thu, 0 buổi đi)
and green on a freshly seeded stack on 8299. A fake that agrees with itself is
not evidence, so the numbers in `COMPLETE` below are the ones the real seeded
machine reported, not numbers invented here.
