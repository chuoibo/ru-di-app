"""A ratchet that keeps unformatted Python out of tests/qa/.

Three files from rd-qa-37 reached main while `ruff format` rejected all three.
Nothing was broken about the gate that should have stopped them: the CI job
`ruff on changed files` runs `scripts/ruff_changed.sh`, which would have caught
them on the pull request. It simply never executed -- GitHub Actions started no
job at all during the billing outage of 2026-08-29, so the change went to main
unchecked.

That is the hole this file covers. `ruff_changed.sh` is a *diff* gate: standing
on main with nothing changed, it finds zero candidate files, prints "no Python
files changed" and exits 0. That is correct behaviour for a diff gate and wrong
as a safety net -- it means main's own contents are never re-examined by
anything that runs locally. A check that reports success while inspecting
nothing is the exact failure mode that let these three files land, so this gate
asserts that it inspected something before it is allowed to pass.

Why a ratchet and not `ruff format --check tests/qa`:

19 of the 25 Python files under tests/qa/ are unformatted on main. A blanket
gate would be red on the commit that introduces it, and the only way to land it
green would be to reformat 16 files belonging to other QA turns -- which
CLAUDE.md forbids, because a 16-file formatting diff drowns the real change
underneath it. So the legacy debt is written down in LEGACY_UNFORMATTED and
frozen. It cannot grow, and STALE-entry detection means it can only shrink:
clean a file up and this gate tells you to strike it off the list.

Which ruff renders the verdict:

The pinned one, resolved through `scripts/ruff_pinned.sh` -- never whatever is
first on PATH. This file used to call bare `ruff`, and the allowlist above
carried a note saying that was safe because ruff 0.9.2 (the pin in
services/api/requirements-dev.txt, which CI installs) and ruff 0.15.15 named
the identical dirty set. Re-measured 2026-08-30 at 431dd7c over all 37 files
under tests/qa/, and over all 323 tracked Python files: still identical, still
zero divergence. So the note was true.

It was also a fact about today's tree offered as if it were a guarantee, which
is the same reasoning `scripts/ruff_pinned.sh` was written to remove from the
lint stage: "a verdict from the wrong tool is not the verdict". Every file the
QA lane adds under tests/qa/ is a fresh chance for the two to disagree, and the
gate would report the local binary's answer as CI's. The allowlist is frozen
against version drift now by construction rather than by re-measurement.

Cost of doing it this way, stated plainly: on a machine with no pinned ruff and
no network, `scripts/ruff_pinned.sh` exits 2 and this gate goes red where it
used to go green on the wrong binary. That is the intended direction. The
message says how to fix it.

Note that tests/qa/ sits outside services/api/pyproject.toml, so ruff applies
its default configuration here -- line-length 88, not the project's. That is
why most of the diff this gate demands is line wrapping.
