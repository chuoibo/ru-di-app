"""What the route-existence gate must catch, and what it must not report.

`scripts/check_api_contract.py` is a reader, and a reader has exactly one
failure mode worth fearing: going quiet. While it was being written its
statement scanner stopped at a parameter list, and it reported nothing and
exited 0 -- indistinguishable from a clean tree, and the same shape as the
detector with no browser and the postgres tier with no database that this
repository has already been bitten by.

So these tests come in three parts, and all three are load bearing:

  - The gate BITES on the defect that really shipped: a call to
    `/batches/current/publish`, a route that has never existed, recorded in
    `src/api.ts`'s own header comment.
  - The gate stays QUIET about prose. This codebase documents its past mistakes
    by name, so its comments are full of routes that do not exist. A checker
    that read comments would fail `main` on the strength of a docstring, get
    switched off, and catch nothing ever again.
  - The reader does not GO BLIND. Two shapes in the real client -- a regular
    expression in the middle of a URL, and a path two declarations away from
    the request -- each made it silently stop finding anything.

The reader is exercised on snippets against a hand-built contract, so a failure
here names the reading rule that broke rather than "something in apps/mobile".
