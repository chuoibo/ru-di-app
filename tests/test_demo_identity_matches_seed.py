"""The app's demo people must be the rows the seed script actually writes.

Two files now carry the same seven ids: `tests/fixtures/legacy_demo/seed_demo_data.py` derives
them with `uuid5`, and `apps/mobile/src/rudi/nhom-demo.ts` has them
written out because Hermes cannot derive a `uuid5` without shipping SHA-1.

Duplicated constants drift. This one drifts *silently*, which is why it is
worth a test rather than a comment: the personal screen would ask the API about
a person who does not exist, and the API would answer correctly -- 200, all
zeros, no transactions. A wrong id and a person who has genuinely never split a
bill produce the same screen. Nobody debugging that starts by suspecting a
constant.

Parses the TypeScript rather than executing it, so this test needs no Node and
runs in the same `pytest` invocation as everything else.
