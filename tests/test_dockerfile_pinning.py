"""The base-image pinning gate must bite, and it must bite on this tree.

`scripts/check_dockerfile_pinning.sh` has existed since the `docker` job was
written, and until this file it was referenced exactly once in the whole
repository: by `.github/workflows/test.yml`. That was survivable while Actions
ran. It stopped being survivable at 07:45Z on 2026-08-29, when Actions began
refusing to start jobs over billing -- from then the gate did not merely go
unenforced, it did not execute at all, and nothing said so, because every pull
request was already showing a red X for the billing reason.

So the gate moves here, into `python3 -m pytest services/api/tests tests -q`,
which needs no Actions, no database and no Docker daemon: the script is text
analysis of a Dockerfile, and text is all it reads.

Both halves are load bearing, the same way they are in `test_alembic_heads.py`:

  * `test_the_real_dockerfile_is_digest_pinned` is *the gate*. It goes red on
    the day somebody writes `FROM python:3.12-slim` with no digest, and that is
    the only reason any of this exists.
  * the synthetic cases prove the gate **knows how to be red**. A gate observed
    only in the green has not been distinguished from a gate that cannot fail,
    and this repository counted five of those in a single afternoon.

Every case runs the real script through `subprocess` and reads its real exit
code. Exit codes are what a hook and a workflow act on, so exit codes are what
gets tested -- not a reimplementation of the parsing compared against itself.

What this does not cover: the rest of the `docker` job -- that the image builds,
runs as non-root, ships no pytest, and answers its own HEALTHCHECK. Those need a
Docker daemon and cannot join the standard command. They remain Actions-only and
are, today, not running anywhere.
