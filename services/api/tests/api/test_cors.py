"""Cross-origin policy for the browser build of the app.

The native build sends no ``Origin`` header, so it never noticed that the API
had no CORS policy at all. The web build did: the browser preflights every
request that carries ``X-Actor-ID``, the preflight reached the router instead of
a CORS layer, and the router answered 405 for a method it has no route for. Not
one request got through.

These tests pin the browser-visible contract, not the middleware's identity.
