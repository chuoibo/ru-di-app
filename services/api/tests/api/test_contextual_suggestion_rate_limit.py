"""The F33 card reaches Gemini on a GET, and arrived after the file that meters.

``GET /contexts/{id}/contextual-suggestion`` calls the model on every request
that finds a conversation. There is no cache in front of it and there cannot be
a useful one: the card is a function of one group's last few messages, and any
cache coarser than that would serve one group's evening to another.

That is the same shape ``GET /contexts/{id}/suggestion`` had before #293, and
the reason this file exists is that #293 could not have caught it -- F33 did not
exist yet. ``test_every_paid_route_carries_its_own_window`` enumerates the
limiters it knows by name, so a *new* unmetered route is invisible to it. The
last two cases here read the roster off the application instead.

That distinction was not academic. The case those two replace made the same
claim in its docstring while hand-listing seven attribute names, and #297 then
added an eighth door -- ``GET /places`` and its ``CachedReasonWriter`` -- which
it did not notice, because a name absent from the list cannot fail a count of
the list.

What this file does NOT prove: that the ceiling is the right number, or that it
survives a second replica. The window is per process and in memory, so two API
replicas mean twice the ceiling and a restart forgives everyone -- a
blast-radius cap for a single-box demo, not a quota. Same limit the sibling
files state about the routes they cover.
