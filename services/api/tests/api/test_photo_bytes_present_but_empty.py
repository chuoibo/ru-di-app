"""Bytes that are gone and bytes that are empty must answer the same way.

## What this file locks down

`qa2-062305` (#434) walked the two routes that hand image bytes to a client
through eight ways the picture behind a record can be missing or wrong, and
found one pair that disagreed for no reason a caller could act on:

  B  the row is there, the file was deleted   -> ``404``, a refusal
  D  the row is there, the file is 0 bytes    -> ``200``, ``image/jpeg``, no body

Both mean the same thing to whoever asked: the ledger lists a photograph and
storage cannot produce it. ``200`` with an empty body is not a thinner answer
than ``404``, it is a **wrong** one -- it says "here is your picture" and then
hands over nothing. The client measurement in that PR followed it the rest of
the way: `taiAnhCoQuyen` treats every 2xx as success, mints a ``blob:`` URL over
zero bytes, the browser fires ``error``, and the screen falls back to the same
placeholder it shows for a group that has no photos at all. No message, no
retry, no log line -- on either side. That silence is the defect; the status
code is only where it starts.

The decision recorded on #434 was to make D answer exactly what B answers.

## Why each case asserts "same as B" rather than a literal code string

The two routes do not share a not-found code: photos raise `photo_not_found`,
avatars raise `avatar_not_found`. Pinning both to one literal would give the
avatar route a code its own B condition does not use, splitting D from B on that
route -- which is the exact shape the decision removes. So every case asserts
that D is indistinguishable from B **on its own route**: same status, same body,
byte for byte. That is the property that was decided, stated as an assertion
instead of as two hard-coded strings that can drift apart later.

## Why H is here

Without the healthy control, a stack that answers 404 to everything -- a broken
fixture, a route that never gets reached, a permission gate closing early --
passes B and D and proves nothing at all.

## Why the route list is derived from the tree, not typed out here

`ROUTES` below is checked against a list built by walking the AST of
`app/api/routes/` for `Response(content=...)`, which is the same unit qa2 used
to find that there are exactly two such routes. A hand-written list cannot
notice a third byte-serving route being added next month; a derived one goes red
and names the function nobody covered. Counting by a shape the code cannot
rename is the lesson #437 paid for tonight.

## What this file does NOT prove

Nothing here says a *user* can reach condition D. #434 measured that separately
and found they cannot: every input the upload door accepts lands more than zero
bytes on disk, and a write killed halfway under a real ``RLIMIT_FSIZE`` ceiling
leaves nothing behind at all. D arrives from outside the product -- a restore
that stopped early, a copied volume, a filesystem that lost a tail. The reason
to answer it correctly is that the product cannot tell which of those happened,
not that a caller can cause it.

Condition E -- a file with the wrong number of bytes in it, junk rather than an
image -- is deliberately **not** asserted here. It still answers ``200``. No
decision has been made about it, and inventing one inside a regression file is
how a gate ends up enforcing something nobody agreed to.
