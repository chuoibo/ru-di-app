"""Server-side enforcement of `Idempotency-Key` on write requests.

The mobile client already generates a key per attempt and reuses it on retry.
Until now the server ignored it, so a flaky network, a double tap, or an
automatic retry could write the same money twice. Holding the key on the client
is not protection: the client is the party that cannot be trusted to be online.

These tests drive the HTTP semantics against an in-memory store. They prove the
middleware's contract, NOT the database. The unique constraint, the race between
two connections, and the "one row landed" claim are proved in
``tests/postgres/test_idempotency_postgres.py`` against real PostgreSQL, because
a dict cannot refuse a duplicate insert.
