What this tier proves and what it does not
------------------------------------------
These run against the fake repository, so they prove the wire shape, the
deterministic score, and the refusal rules. They do **not** prove anything
about Gemini: the reason writer is injected, and the tests here supply one that
never touches the network. The live model call has its own tier in
``tests/live/test_places_gemini_live.py``, which is skipped without a key --
and a skip there is not a green.

The rule these tests exist to hold is the one rd-be-05 was written for: a score
is only ever shown next to a reason somebody can check, and a sentence nobody
generated is never served wearing an ``ai`` label.
