"""PR #301 -- a guest link is not a key to F31/F33/F36.

`/g/{token}` is the one place in this product where a stranger is handed a
working URL. The three routes this branch adds are the three most concentrated
reads it owns: what a group eats, what a group is saying right now, and every
photograph they took on a trip. Nothing wires them together, and this file is
what makes "nothing" checkable rather than believed.

The positive control is the whole test. Each case below first fetches the
guest page and asserts it renders -- so the token in hand is live, valid, and
unexpired -- and only then shows that the same token opens none of the four
new endpoints. Without that first half, every refusal here is equally
satisfied by a token that was already broken, which is the failure mode a
"guest cannot reach X" test falls into by default.

`X-Actor-ID` is a claim rather than a credential in this slice (see
`app/api/deps.py`), so a guest can put anything in it. That is why the cases
below try the token *as* an actor id, and try a well-formed random one: the
question is not whether the product trusts guests, it is what the product does
when a guest simply asserts they are somebody.
