"""The second half of the `image_url` gate, checked on its own.

The schema refuses anything that is not `/contexts/{uuid}/photos/{uuid}`, and
the service then compares the context in that path against the context being
written. Those are two layers, and this file pins the lower one down by
itself.

Why it deserves its own file: a mutation run that loosened the schema pattern
turned this helper into a `ValueError` -- a 500, from a request body. The
helper had quietly inherited the schema's promise that it would only ever see
a well formed path. A 500 is a worse answer than a 422 (it pages somebody, it
reads as a server bug, and it is the shape an attacker probes for), so the
helper now refuses malformed input on its own rather than trusting the layer
above it to have run.
