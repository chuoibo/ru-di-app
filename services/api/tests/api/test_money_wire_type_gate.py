"""Money law 1 at the wire: no money field anywhere accepts a non-integer.

`schemas.py` says it already: a JSON string such as ``"82000"`` *or a float such
as ``82000.0``* is a malformed caller precondition, and neither may reach the
allocator. Two shapes are named there. Only the string was ever tested, by
``test_malformed_wire_money_never_reaches_domain_or_storage``, and that one test
lives on one field of one route.

That gap is measurable rather than theoretical. Teaching ``MoneyVnd`` to accept
an integral float -- the change someone makes the first time a JavaScript client
posts ``82000.0``, because JS has no integer type -- leaves the whole suite
green at 1622 passed. The string test stays green because strings are still
refused, so the one gate that exists says nothing about the shape beside it.

Three shapes get in when a money field is declared lax, and each is a different
kind of wrong:

    "82000"     a string, the shape already covered
    82000.0     a float, which is money law 1 broken by definition
    true        a bool, which pydantic coerces to 1 -- a bill of one dong

The bool is the one worth staring at. ``bool`` subclasses ``int`` in Python, so
every ``isinstance(x, int)`` written to defend money says yes to ``True``. The
allocator has no type check of its own: handed ``total_vnd=True`` it raises
nothing and splits one dong across the group. ``vietqr.build_payload`` is the
layer that already knew this and spells ``isinstance(amount_vnd, bool)`` out
before its int check.

So this file does two things the existing test does not:

1. It probes every money field on every request body the app actually serves,
   found by walking the routes rather than by listing names here -- a list would
   go stale the first time someone adds a route, and go stale silently.
2. It asserts on behaviour, not on how pydantic spells strictness internally.
   A field passes only by refusing the value.

Scope, stated so the green is readable: this gate covers fields carrying money
on *request* bodies. Response models are deliberately out -- a lax int there
launders a float the service already computed, which is a different defect with
a different fix, recorded in the PR rather than half-covered here.
