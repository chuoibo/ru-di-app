"""A confirmed expense may only charge people the group actually contains.

The three money rules in `CLAUDE.md` are all arithmetic: integer dong, the
allocations sum to the total, the balance recomputes from the ledger. An
expense naming a stranger satisfies every one of them. `41` golden vectors
stay green, the sum still reconciles to the last dong, and the ledger still
replays -- onto a person who was never in the group.

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-29 the split screen minted a fresh
`person` per typed name and wrote `329_667 + 329_667 + 329_666 = 989_000`,
perfect to the dong, to three people who did not exist. The real person's
balance did not move. The client half of that has since changed; the server
half had not, and the server is the half that decides what the ledger says.

`confirm_expense` proved the *actor* belongs to the context and then took
`proposal.participants` from the request body unchecked. Nothing downstream
re-asks: `ConfirmedAllocation.participant_id` and `ExpenseItemShare.participant_id`
carry no foreign key into `people`, so not even PostgreSQL refuses a UUID
nobody has ever seen.

Ownership is a separate invariant from arithmetic, and it needs its own gate.
