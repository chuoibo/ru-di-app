"""Membership on the money path must be read from the roster, not from the caller.

`X-Actor-Contexts` is a header the caller writes. `CLAUDE.md` says so plainly,
and says not to build on the assumption it is safe. This file is not a report
that the header is untrusted -- that is already written down. It is about a
narrower thing that is a bug even *under the trust model the header assumes*:

the codebase answers "is this actor in this group?" two different ways, and the
routes that move money picked the weaker one.

    thirty-odd call sites   `self.repository.is_member(context_id, actor.id)`
    five call sites         `context_id in actor.context_ids`

The five are `_bill_for_actor`, `create_bill`, `confirm_expense`, `create_batch`
and the collection board -- exactly the hero path, and nothing else. The first
form asks the database. The second asks the request that is trying to get in,
so `<group> in {<group>}` is true for whatever group the caller typed.

Even a perfect gateway does not close this. A gateway can overwrite `X-Actor-ID`
because it knows who authenticated; it cannot correctly fill `X-Actor-Contexts`
because group membership lives in a table it does not own. So the header cannot
be made right by the boundary it was designed for. Membership is a fact about
`memberships`, and only `memberships` can be asked.

`#235` closed the neighbouring half of this: it stopped a confirmed expense from
charging a *participant* the group does not contain, by reading the roster. The
gate on the *actor* kept reading the header, so today a person who is in no
group at all can write a confirmed expense into someone else's ledger, charging
that group's real members, and then open a collection batch that mails those
members a demand for the money.

There is already a `TestGroupBoundary` in `test_bills.py`, and it is green, and
one of its cases is named `test_an_outsider_cannot_create_a_bill_in_someone_
elses_group`. It passes because its outsider sends `X-Actor-Contexts` naming a
*different* group, so the set membership honestly fails. That is the intruder
who fills the form in truthfully. Nobody attacking this writes their real group
in the box; they write the victim's. Those cases can only go red if the check is
deleted outright, never if it is asking the wrong source -- so the suite reads
as though ownership were gated here while the door stands open. Every case below
sends the victim's context id, which is the only version an attacker would send.

The three money rules stay green throughout. Integer dong, allocations summing
to the total, a balance that replays from the ledger -- an intruder's expense
satisfies all three, exactly as a stranger participant did. Ownership is a
separate invariant, and this is its second door.
