"""The taint boundary of the F12 search prompt (rd-be-10).

`tests/api/test_places_prompt_boundary.py` holds one invariant for `GET
/places`: *no text a caller can type reaches the Gemini prompt.* That gate stays
exactly as it is, and `test_a_search_never_leaks_into_the_browse_prompt` below
is the one new thing this feature owes it.

F12 cannot make the same promise. Putting the person's sentence in front of the
model **is** the feature, so this is the first real prompt-injection surface in
the service -- unlike `/places`, whose catalogue is a hard-coded literal, and
unlike the receipt scanner, whose input is an image. The promise therefore
changes shape rather than weakening:

* **Containment, not exclusion.** The query is data inside the prompt, encoded
  so it cannot close its own envelope and start issuing instructions. Everything
  else in the prompt is a pure function of the seed catalogue.
* **The output is where it is actually stopped.** Even a model that fully obeys
  an injected instruction can only hand back identifiers, and an identifier it
  invented sinks the whole answer (`app/domain/place_search.py`). The tests here
  that matter most are the ones that assume the injection *worked*.

That last point is why none of this rests on the model resisting anything. A
defence that requires the model to be clever is a defence that fails the first
time it is not.
