"""Money law 1 on the way out: no money field on a response launders a non-int.

The sibling file `test_money_wire_type_gate.py` closed the request side and said
in its own docstring that responses were deliberately left out, because a lax
`int` there launders a value the service already computed -- a different defect
with a different fix. This is that fix.

Laundering is the whole problem, and it is worth stating precisely because it is
what makes the defect invisible rather than merely present. A field declared
plain `int` in pydantic v2 runs in lax mode, so:

    82000.0  ->  82000     a float that reached money, rendered as if it never did
    True     ->  1         a one-dong amount, rendered as money
    "82000"  ->  82000     a string that reached money, likewise

Only `82000.5` is refused, and it is refused as a 500. So the shapes that get
through are exactly the ones a reader cannot tell apart from a correct answer,
and the shape that fails does so in the least useful way.

That is why no assertion on an HTTP body can catch this. By the time a test can
read `response.json()["spend_vnd"]`, pydantic has already turned the service's
`Decimal("520000")` or `520000.0` into `520000`. The test compares `520000 ==
520000` and passes. The suite is structurally incapable of noticing, which is a
stronger statement than "nobody wrote the test yet": writing more body
assertions would not help.

What is upstream today. Every current producer of these figures is guarded
somewhere: the repository casts its `SUM`s (`tests/qa/rd-qa-39` measures that
those casts are individually gated), `_integer_dong` guards the model-authored
budget and history figures, and Go's receipt.NormalizeVND guards receipt money. So this
gate does not fix a live wrong number. It removes the wire's dependence on all
of those guards staying correct, and on the next money field being added by
someone who knows about them.

The asymmetry that gives the game away is in `FinanceMovementView`: the
counterparty's *name* is `StrictStr`, and the *amount of money* is a plain
`int`. Nobody decided that money deserved less checking than a display name.

One trap, recorded because this file's author walked into it while measuring.
Classifying a field as strict by reading `field.metadata` is wrong: for
`allocations: dict[UUID, MoneyVnd]` the strictness lives in the dict's *value*
type and the field's own metadata is empty, so a metadata check reports the
allocator's own output as lax. Read by behaviour instead -- a field passes only
by refusing the value -- which is what the sibling file concluded for its own
reasons and what every case below does.
