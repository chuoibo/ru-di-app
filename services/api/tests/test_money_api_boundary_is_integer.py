"""Law 1 at the HTTP boundary: money crossing the API may not be inexact.

## Why this gate exists, in one sentence

``tests/postgres/test_money_columns_are_integer_postgres.py`` (#486) ends by
saying the database is *not* the last line of defence and that "the real last
line is the type check in ``allocate()`` and the pydantic boundary". That
sentence was an assertion nobody had ever measured. This file measures it.

## What this gate counts, and why that unit was chosen

The unit of counting is **the FastAPI application object that ``main`` actually
builds** -- ``app.routes``, walked into every pydantic model reachable from a
route's request body, response model, query parameters and path parameters.
It is not a hand-written list of model names or route names.

A hand-written list cannot notice a model nobody added it to, so it reports
"all clear" for exactly the change it was supposed to catch. Walking the built
app means a model added tomorrow is measured tomorrow, under whatever name its
author chose.

Query and path parameters are collected **separately** from the model walk, and
the reason is worth stating because it was found by mutation rather than by
reading. Mutant W2 removed query and path parameters from the walk and the gate
stayed green: measured on this tree there are 101 such parameters and *none* is
a pydantic model, so feeding them to a model walk discovers exactly nothing.
Passing them to the walk and calling that coverage would have been a claim with
no measurement under it. One of those 101 is money --
``candidate_per_person_vnd`` on ``GET /contexts/{context_id}/budget`` -- and it
is the single place where a client controls a money value that no model-shaped
rule in this file can see. It gets its own test below.

## The rules, and why none subsumes another

**Rule A -- behavioural, over money-named fields.** Every field whose *name*
says money must *refuse* a fractional value **and accept a plain integer**.
Both directions are checked by handing real values -- ``300.5``,
``Decimal("300.5")``, ``300`` -- to the field's real annotation through a real
``TypeAdapter``. It is deliberately not a check on the declared type.

The second direction is not decoration. Refusal alone is satisfied by a field
that refuses *everything*: a money field annotated ``str`` refuses ``300.5``
and would sail through a refuse-only rule, which is how money-as-text gets in.
Measured, not assumed: ``TypeAdapter(str).validate_python(300.5)`` raises, and
so does ``validate_python(300)`` -- so the accept direction is what catches it.

That distinction is the whole point of the rule. A frozen dataclass observed on
2026-08-31 declared two fields ``int`` and carried a ``Decimal`` in one of
them: ``ObligationAmounts(obligation_amount_vnd=40000,
confirmed_amount_vnd=Decimal("0"))``. A type *declaration* is not a check. So
this gate never reads ``Strict(strict=True)`` metadata, never reads an
annotation's repr, and never asks whether a field "is an int". It runs the
value and looks at what happens.

**Rule B -- structural, over inexact types, deny by default.** Every ``float``
or ``Decimal`` field reachable in the contract must appear in
``INEXACT_API_FIELDS_REVIEWED`` with the reason it is not money. This is the
mirror at the HTTP boundary of the schema-side rule in #486, and it is stated
over the field's *type* rather than its *name* for the same reason: a money
field that ignores the ``_vnd`` naming convention is invisible to any rule
phrased over names, and the reviewer writing the name list cannot know it is
missing.

Rule A is blind to a money field called ``gia_tri``; Rule B catches it the
moment it is inexact. Rule B is blind to money stored as ``str``, because
``str`` is not an inexact numeric type; Rule A's accept direction catches it.
A money field has to satisfy both.

**Rule C -- the allowlist is checked in both directions.** An entry in
``INEXACT_API_FIELDS_REVIEWED`` that no longer matches a discovered field fails
the gate as loudly as an undeclared inexact field does. This is what makes the
gate non-trivial: if the traversal below ever breaks and discovers nothing,
every one of the reviewed entries becomes stale and the gate goes red. There is
no state in which a broken walker prints green.

That property is deliberate and load-bearing. A sibling gate was failed in
review (#492) for resting on ``assert count > 0``, which stays green when a
walker silently loses most of its input. "Not empty" is not a measurement.

## What this gate does NOT prove -- read this before quoting it

* **It does not prove the fence is strict.** It proves fractional values are
  refused. Measured on the tree this landed on: 51 of 62 money fields also
  accept ``300.0``, ``"300"`` and ``True`` -- pydantic's lax mode coerces all
  three to an int, silently. ``True`` becoming ``1`` is not hypothetical
  strictness pedantry: it is the exact mirror of the database, which *refuses*
  a bool and silently *rounds* a float. The two layers refuse disjoint sets.
  Neither is a fence on its own, and this file measures only one of them.
* **It does not cover routes with no pydantic field at all.** Ten routes carry
  a response out without any response model; they are pinned in
  ``ROUTES_WITHOUT_RESPONSE_VALIDATION`` below. Six of them are the guest HTML
  pages, and those pages *do* render money. For that money there is no pydantic
  boundary whatsoever -- the value is formatted into a template. This gate
  states that hole, it does not close it.
* **It does not prove any value is correct.** A field that refuses ``300.5``
  will happily accept ``300`` when the right answer was ``400``. Law 2 is the
  golden vectors' job, not this file's.
* **It says nothing about money inside ``jsonb`` or inside a free-form dict.**
  A field annotated ``dict`` is opaque to pydantic's numeric machinery and so
  is opaque here.
