"""The live tier for the group companion: a real call to Gemini, or nothing.

Every other companion test injects `FakeCompanion`, so none of them can answer
the question the feature is actually judged on: does a REAL model, handed a real
group conversation, stay inside the server's catalogue and stay out of the money?

Skipped by default, and a skip here is not a green -- it is this claim going
unmade. Run it with:

    set -a && . /path/to/.env && set +a
    cd services/api && MOBILE_REQUIRE_GEMINI_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/live -q

What it proves
--------------
* The model answers, in Vietnamese, with one of the three renderable kinds.
* **Every place_id it returns exists in the catalogue it was handed.** This is
  the "không bịa địa điểm" acceptance criterion measured against the model
  rather than against the server that would have caught it anyway.
* The model reads the real conversation: asked about a specific constraint the
  group typed, its choice respects that constraint.
* **Text a group member typed is data, not instructions.** Chat content flows
  straight into the prompt, which makes this the most direct injection surface
  in the product -- more direct than the place names gated in #81.

What it does not prove
----------------------
That the suggestion is *good*, or that a Vietnamese reader finds it natural --
nobody has read these next to the places yet. Nor is it a distribution: the
injection cases run a handful of samples at temperature 0.0, not enough to bound
a rate. A green run means "no fabrication observed in these samples", never "the
model cannot fabricate".

Note the division of labour with the other tiers. If the model DOES get steered,
the product is still safe -- `ground_card` refuses any id it did not issue, and
`tests/domain/test_companion.py` proves that refusal. This file exists to tell us
whether the prompt is holding, because a server that keeps refusing a steered
model is a feature nobody can use.
