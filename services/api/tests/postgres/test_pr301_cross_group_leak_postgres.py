"""PR #301 (F31/F33/F36) -- what a refusal actually carries, and the shelf's cover.

`test_group_intelligence_postgres.py` already proves the strangers are refused.
This file exists because of *how* it proves it: every refusal there is checked
with a needle -- `assert "BBQ" not in response.text`, `assert "Đà Lạt" not in
response.text`. A needle answers "is this one string absent", which is a
weaker question than the one the gate has to survive:

  * it is green when the fixture never wrote the needle in the first place,
  * it is green on a body that leaked a hundred rows and merely spelled the
    category differently, and
  * it says nothing at all about the fields the needle does not name --
    `checkin_count`, `split_total_vnd`, `photo_count`, a cover's `image_url`.

So the refusals below are checked structurally instead: a refused body must
carry the two keys of an error and **zero records at any depth**. That is the
assertion the shape of the response cannot satisfy by accident.

Three things here are not covered anywhere else in the suite:

1. **The header does not decide.** `X-Actor-Contexts` is a claim a client
   chooses. Every refusal below is re-run by a caller who names the victim
   group in that header, because "the gate reads `is_member` and not the
   header" is a property of the running code, not of the code review that
   observed it.

2. **The shelf's cover.** The overlap case is proved on
   `GET /contexts/{id}/albums/{outing_id}` and not on the shelf, and the shelf
   builds a cover through the same `_album_of`. One gate with two call sites is
   how a check gets removed from the half nobody tested.

3. **A reader who belongs to both groups.** A refusal test whose reader belongs
   to only one group passes even when the filter is keyed on the *reader*
   rather than on the context in the path.

Uses `flush`, never `commit`, for the reason the neighbouring file gives: this
directory's schema is shared and row-counting tests elsewhere go red if rows
from here survive.
