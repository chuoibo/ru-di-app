"""The session door, on real PostgreSQL: `POST /sessions` and what guards it.

The fake in `tests/api` proves the HTTP orchestration and the mode switch. It
cannot prove any of the things this file is about, because all of them are
statements about the database: a check constraint that had to be relaxed
without losing its surviving half, a partial unique index that makes re-inviting
impossible and rotation necessary, a digest column that must actually be
emptied when a secret is spent, and a membership row that must keep its state
when the same person signs in again.

Every application here is built with `auth_mode="prod"` on purpose. The suite
exports `dev`, and a bootstrap test that quietly ran under the header adapter
would be measuring nothing.

    Two claims, and the second is the one that matters. `membership_id` is only
    worth carrying if the client can *do* something with it, and what it must
    be able to do is exactly one thing: consent for itself. ADR-0014 s8 says a
    named invitation carries an existing member's choice, so the invitee
    consents rather than waits -- `accept_context_membership` requires only
    `is_invitee`.

    Before this field the product had a door that opened onto a wall. Somebody
    could redeem a real invitation over real HTTP, hold a real session, and
    then sit at `invited` with no reachable button: `POST /memberships/{id}/
    accept` needs an id, and the only route that lists memberships is behind
    the membership being accepted.

    The acceptance is driven THROUGH HTTP with the session's own bearer, not
    through the service object. A service-level call proves the domain rule and
    nothing about whether the token this route just minted is accepted by the
    route the screen calls next -- which is the whole of what a phone does.
