"""Law 1 on the storage side: no money column may hold a non-integer type.

## What this gate counts, and why that unit was chosen

The table-level completeness unit is **the SQLAlchemy model metadata**, compared
with the tables returned by ``information_schema.columns``. It is not a
hand-written list of table or column names. A hand-written list cannot notice a
table nobody added to it, so it reports "all clear" for exactly the change it
was supposed to catch.

The schema read is not assumed complete merely because it returns many rows.
Every model table must be represented in the read, and every returned column is
then classified **deny by default**. Within the numeric family, a money column
added tomorrow is caught whatever it is called, because the rule is stated over
the column's *type*, not over its *name*:

    every inexact-numeric column must appear in INEXACT_COLUMNS_REVIEWED

So ``numeric``, ``real``, ``double precision`` and ``money`` cannot enter the
schema unnoticed. The reviewed set is two geographic coordinates, and each
entry carries the reason it is not money. Adding a third entry is a visible,
reviewable act in a diff -- which is the point.

A second, name-side rule runs the other way and catches money stored in a type
that is not numeric at all (``text``, ``varchar``, ``jsonb``) when the column
matches the repository's ``_vnd``/``amount`` naming convention. Neither rule
subsumes the other, and the naming heuristic is intentionally not exhaustive.

## What this gate does NOT prove -- read this before quoting it

* **It is about STORAGE, not EXPRESSIONS.** ``bigint`` columns say nothing
  about what a *query* returns. PostgreSQL widens to ``numeric`` in places the
  column types cannot predict -- ``sum()``, ``avg()``, ``round()``, integer
  division, a numeric literal mixed into an expression, or raw ``text("...")``
  SQL. That class of defect was real (#475: ``func.sum()`` returned ``Decimal``
  out of ``app/db/repository.py``) and this gate would not have caught it.
  There is no count over column types that answers "every SQL expression
  returning money is an int"; that question is answered at runtime, on the
  values the repository actually hands back.
* **A money column can evade both rules by using both an unconventional name
  and a type outside the numeric family.** For example, ``gia_tri text`` and
  ``total text`` match neither detector. The last line of defence for this gap
  is the type check in ``allocate()`` plus the pydantic boundary, not a longer
  hand-written name list here.
* **It does not read inside ``jsonb``.** PostgreSQL applies no numeric type to
  a value nested in a JSON document, so money inside ``jsonb`` is outside every
  rule stated here. The blind spot is bounded rather than silent: the jsonb
  columns are enumerated from the same migrated schema and pinned below, so a
  *new* jsonb column cannot appear without a reviewer seeing this file.
* **The database is not the last line of defence.** Sending a float to a
  ``bigint`` column does not raise -- PostgreSQL rounds it and stores the
  rounded value (300.5 -> 300). The refusal people expect from a typed column
  only happens for a few types, such as ``bool``. A float that leaks this far
  is stored silently and wrong, with no error anywhere. The real last line is
  the type check in ``allocate()`` and the pydantic boundary.

    that is known to have lost a table -- every table in turn, not a sampled
    one, because a single chosen table only says something about that table.

    The second half measures the floors this rule was added to replace, and it

    remembering a list of names. Two numbers, measured separately, both real:
