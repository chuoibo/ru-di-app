"""`context_id` on the three money tables must point at a group that exists.

`bills`, `expenses` and `collection_batches` were created by the initial
schema, before `contexts` had a table at all. When `contexts` arrived it
retrofitted no foreign key onto them, so their `context_id` stayed what the
`Context` docstring already calls out: a plain UUID pointing at nothing. Every
table added afterwards -- `memberships`, `outings`, `messages`, `posts`,
`votes`, `memories`, `uploaded_images` -- got the key. These three were left
behind, and nothing since has noticed.

What that costs is not theoretical. On the demo database on 2026-08-30,
`public.expenses` carried 10932 rows whose `context_id` matched no row in
`contexts`, 7308 of them with confirmed allocations behind them. Their money
still reaches `GET /people/{id}/finance`, because the spend query walks
`confirmed_allocations -> expense_versions` and never joins `contexts` at all.
So the personal screen adds up đồng from a group that cannot name itself.

The trap to know about when auditing this: an inner JOIN from `expenses` to
`contexts` drops those rows *silently*, and drops them in the flattering
direction -- the reconciliation total comes out smaller, so a checker reports
"clean" while the screen keeps counting. The first measurement of this bug was
off by 329.667đ for exactly that reason. Any query written to audit `expenses`
has to LEFT JOIN or it will agree with itself instead of with the product.

The fix asserted here is the key itself, in both directions:

* nothing may be written into these tables for a group that does not exist;
* and a group that still holds money may not be deleted out from under it,
  which is the other way rows in a live database turn into orphans.

Deliberately not asserted: that any *existing* orphan has been cleaned up.
Removing rows from the ledger is not a schema decision, and the money laws
forbid both silently deleting them and inventing the groups they point at.
The migration therefore enforces every future write and leaves history alone;
see its docstring for what that means for a database that is already dirty.
