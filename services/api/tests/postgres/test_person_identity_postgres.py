"""The identity table, reached over HTTP, against a real PostgreSQL server.

Two failures live here, and they are the same failure seen from both ends.

`contexts.created_by_id` and `memberships.person_id` are foreign keys into
`people`, and no route ever wrote that table. So `POST /contexts` answered HTTP
500 -- `ForeignKeyViolation` on `fk_contexts_created_by` -- for every caller,
including a correct one. There was no request an app could send that would have
worked, because the row the constraint wants had no way in.

From the other end: `get_guest_envelope` never read `people` either, so the
guest page said "Phần của a5b2c277-9b99-4699-a875-ed324e886237". The two things
that page exists to say are who is asking and which debt this is, and a machine
id says neither.

These run against PostgreSQL because both halves are database facts. The fake
repository has no foreign keys, so it cannot produce the 500; and a join it
does not perform cannot be proved by a dictionary lookup it does.
