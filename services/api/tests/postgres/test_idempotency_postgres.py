"""Idempotency against real PostgreSQL, because a dict cannot refuse an insert.

The API-layer tests drive the middleware over an in-memory store. That store
says yes to everything, so it can prove the HTTP contract and nothing else. Two
claims in this feature are claims about the database and can only be tested
here:

* one key can be reserved exactly once, even by two connections at the same
  instant -- that is a unique index doing the work, not Python;
* replaying returns the row that was committed, byte for byte.

The last two tests go through the real ASGI stack against a real schema and
count rows in ``expenses``. That is the acceptance criterion in its literal
form: the same key twice must leave one record behind.
