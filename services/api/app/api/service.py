        Then the outing must belong to *this* context. Without that line, a
        member of any group could pass another group's outing id and read its
        album, because the membership check would have passed on their own
        context. That is exactly the "album as a way around the photo gate"
        failure: the gate would have been asked about the wrong group.

        The repository then joins memories on the outing's own `context_id`,
        so even a bug above cannot assemble a foreign photograph into an album.
        Three layers for one fact, because the photographs are the asset.

        `view_group_memories` permission, proved by the same

        LIMIT 1` written here would be a second, separately gated path to the
        group's photographs. Two paths to one private table is how one of them
        eventually stops being gated; `_scan_checkins` below refuses the same
        shortcut for the same reason.

        `is_member` asks the roster. It does not read `actor.context_ids`: the
        gateway header is a claim by the caller about which groups they are in,
        and #253 had to unpick five call sites that had believed it. A widget
        polls unattended, from a lock screen, on a schedule nobody watches --
        the last surface that should trust a self-asserted membership.
