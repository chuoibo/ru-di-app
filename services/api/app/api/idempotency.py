"""Server-side enforcement of the `Idempotency-Key` header on write requests.

The mobile client already generates a key per attempt and reuses it on retry.
That is the client protecting itself, which is not protection: the client is
precisely the party that loses the network mid-request and cannot know whether
the write landed. Only the server can answer that, and until now it did not
look at the header at all. A double tap, a flaky connection, or an automatic
retry could write the same money twice.

Shape of the guarantee
----------------------
A key is reserved by a single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Exactly one
caller can win that race, whatever the number of processes or connections. The
winner runs the handler; everyone else is told what happened rather than being
allowed to run it again.

Coverage is by construction. This is ASGI middleware, so a write route added
next month is covered the moment it is registered -- there is no list anybody
has to remember to update. Requests that carry no key pass through completely
untouched, original `receive` and `send`, so existing callers and the guest
page's browser form posts behave exactly as before.

A second press is not a second request
--------------------------------------
Two things decide whether the caller's *second* press is answered honestly, and
both were learned from a real server rather than from a dict:

*Order.* The answer is not handed to the caller until the completion has been
recorded. Sending first and bookkeeping afterwards leaves a window in which the
key reads as unfinished, and a thumb is faster than that window: pressing again
the instant the first answer landed was refused four times out of four, while
waiting 50ms was fine. "Be slower" is not something a phone can promise, so the
window is closed by ordering instead.

*Waiting.* Two presses can also arrive at the same instant -- a double render, a
retry racing the original. Exactly one wins the reservation; the loser is the
same request, and the only true answer for it is the winner's. So it waits for
that answer, briefly and with a bounded budget, rather than being refused.

Refusing either case is worse than it looks. It puts a 409 in front of somebody
who did nothing wrong, and an error that invites a fresh key is an invitation to
write the same money twice -- the one thing this file exists to prevent.

The one gap, stated plainly
---------------------------
The completion row is written *after* the request's own transaction has already
committed. If the process dies inside that window, the money is written but the
key stays reserved. A retry then waits out the budget and is told to stop.

That direction is deliberate. The failure mode is "the caller is told to stop
and ask a human", never "the money is written twice". Closing the window
completely means the request transaction itself must own the idempotency row,
which changes transaction ownership for every route and is an ADR-level
decision, not something to smuggle in here.
