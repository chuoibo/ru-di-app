"""Cross-origin policy for browser clients.

The native app sends no ``Origin`` header and is unaffected by any of this. The
web build is not: a browser preflights every request that carries ``X-Actor-ID``,
and a response the browser cannot attribute to an allowed origin is discarded
before the app ever sees it.

The policy is an allowlist, never a wildcard by default. Actor identity travels
in plain headers that a trusted gateway is supposed to overwrite (see
``app.api.deps``), so the set of pages allowed to talk to this API is a decision
an operator makes on purpose, not one this module makes for them.
