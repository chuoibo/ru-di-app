    """Call Gemini once per place, not once per *failed* place per request.

    The seed catalogue and the group profile are both fixed, so a reason is a
    pure function of data that does not change while the process lives. Caching
    it keeps a demo from spending a model call -- and two seconds of someone's
    attention -- every time a tab is opened.

    A row that failed is still retried, because the alternative is worse: a
    Gemini blip during startup must not leave the catalogue permanently
    unlabelled. What changed is *how often*. Caching successes only made "asked
    and got nothing" indistinguishable from "never asked", so a row the model
    will not answer was re-asked on every single request, for the life of the
    process. Three files had already written the old bound down as a safety
    property -- "one call per place per process" -- and used it to argue this
    route needed no ceiling. Measured on `d4bf672`: true when every row
    answers, and false the moment one does not, at 25 model calls for 25
    requests.

    That is not an outage-only path. `parse_reasons` drops a reason whose
    figures are not grounded in the place record, deliberately, and
    `tests/places/test_reasons_batch_robustness.py` measured roughly one first
    load in ten arriving with reasons missing. One ungrounded row in a
    twelve-place catalogue re-armed the whole batch every time.

    It matters here more than it would elsewhere because `GET /places` is the
    only model-spending route in this service with no actor at all: the five
    metered routes key their window on one and `POST /places/search` has
    required one since rd-be-13. An unbounded retry behind an anonymous GET is
    a `while true; do curl; done` pointed at the shared, paid key.

    The ceiling is per place per cooldown, including across threads. The lock
    is dropped before the model call -- holding it across a network round trip
    would serialise every browse behind one -- so the first version of this
    fix bounded requests *in sequence* and nothing else: measured on 78b8148,
    twenty callers in sequence bought one model call and twenty callers at the
    same time bought twenty. Sync routes run in a threadpool, so concurrent is
    what a browser fleet, or `-P 20` on the `while true; do curl; done` this
    docstring uses as its threat, gets for free. `_asking` is what closes it.

    Refusal degrades rather than raising. A suppressed row loses its AI label
    for a minute; the rows that did answer keep theirs, and the route keeps
    serving scores -- which is what `list_places` already does when the writer
    fails outright.

    A caller that arrives while another thread is mid-question degrades the
    same way, and this is a real cost, not a free win: on a cold catalogue,
    nineteen of twenty simultaneous first loads render without AI labels
    rather than waiting on the one call in flight. That is the deliberate
    trade -- the alternative is every browse request queued behind a two
    second model round trip, which is the thing the lock is dropped to avoid.
    The next request after it lands is served from `_answered`.

    Instance state, not module state, and for the reason `build_search_limiter`
    gives at length in the same codebase: a process-wide dict outlives the app
    that owns it, so a suite sharing one has a colour that depends on execution
    order. `create_app` builds one; production builds the app once, so
    production still has exactly one.
