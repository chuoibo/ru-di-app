"""The friend graph over HTTP. F03 (find and ask) and F04 (answer).

Five routes, and one of them needs care that the other four do not.

`POST /friends/lookup` is the only place in this file where a telephone number
crosses the wire, and everything about the handler is shaped by keeping it from
coming back out. Three specific ways it would have leaked, all closed here:

**FastAPI's own 422 echoes the input.** A pydantic model for the body means a
caller who posts `phone` as a JSON *number* gets that number returned under an
`"input"` key. `routes/identity.py` measured that against this app and parses
its body by hand for the same reason; so does this. Every refusal below is a
fixed sentence with no interpolation.

**The number must not reach a path or a query string.** uvicorn's access log
records method and path. So this is a POST with the number in the body, never
`GET /friends/lookup?phone=...`.

**The answer must be an id and a name, not a record.** The response model is
`PersonMatchResponse`: `person_id` and `display_name`. There is no field for a
telephone number, and there is no column behind one either -- the server never
stored the number in the first place (`app/api/person_identity.py`). So "find a
friend by phone must not return somebody else's phone" is not a filter someone
has to remember to apply; it is a thing the schema cannot express and the
database cannot supply.

What this route *is*, honestly: an oracle for "does this number have an
account". A caller who did not know Binh uses Rủ Đi learns it by asking. That
is the same trade `person_identity.py` documents for id derivation, narrowed
two ways -- it needs an actor header, so it is not anonymous, and it is rate
limited per caller. A limit is a cost, not a wall. Removing the oracle needs a
mutual-contacts design the product does not have yet, and pretending otherwise
in a comment would be worse than saying so.
