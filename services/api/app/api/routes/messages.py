    `plan_turn` already refuses to speak while the companion spoke last, and
    that is a conversation cadence rather than a ceiling: the caller lifts it
    by posting one more message, so an unmetered loop costs two cheap requests
    per model call instead of one. The window is what makes the cost bounded.

    Charged before the cadence is consulted, so a poll that would have been
    answered `already_spoke_last` still spends a slot. That is deliberate: the
    order that spares those calls is the order that lets a loop drive the
    expensive path for free, because which one a request becomes is decided by
    the caller. Thirty a minute is far above anyone typing and far below a loop.

    That ordering is also why `requested` is safe to accept from the client. It
    lifts the cadence, never the window: a caller that sets it on every request
    buys the same thirty turns a minute as one that never sets it.

    The body is optional because the shipped client sends none -- it posts this
    route with a JSON content type over zero bytes, so a required model would
    turn every AI turn in the product into a 422.
