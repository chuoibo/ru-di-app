"""How much of the project's model quota one identity may spend per minute.

Every actor-keyed model door owns a window here.  The file is still named for
search because that was the first route it protected; the ceilings and refusal
wording are per caller and per feature, set at construction.

`POST /places/search` calls Gemini on every request, and until rd-be-13 it did
so for anyone who could reach the port. Requiring an actor closes the anonymous
half of that, but only half: `X-Actor-ID` is asserted by a trusted gateway that
this slice does not have yet (see `app/api/deps.py`), so today a header is a
claim rather than a credential. A gate that stops the anonymous caller and lets
the header-forging one through unmetered has moved the cost, not capped it.

Hence a window, and hence it is counted **per actor**. A single global counter
would be simpler and would be an outage waiting to happen: one person holding
down refresh would take search away from everybody, which is the exact failure
this module exists to prevent, merely caused by us instead of by them.

What this is not
----------------
Per-process, in memory. Two API replicas mean two windows and therefore twice
the ceiling, and a restart forgives everyone. That is honest for a single-box
demo and would be wrong to describe as a quota: the real one belongs in front
of the app, or in shared storage, and neither exists in this slice. The number
here is a blast-radius cap, not an accounting system.

# are both negligible. Against a real person the choice matters a lot. Someone
# re-shooting a bill that keeps coming out blurred, then a second bill, with
# the client retrying underneath them, reaches low double digits in a minute;
# refused at that point they watch the feature fail with nothing they can do.
#
# So the ceiling sits well above any plausible human burst and far below loop

    retry on 429, each retry pushes the window out ahead of itself, and a burst

    Note how narrow that claim is, because the obvious wider one is false.
    *Counting* a refusal is harmless: the count is reset when the window rolls,

    the timestamp matters. This docstring said "counting" first, and a mutant
