    Nothing here is cached and nothing is stored. That is invariant 3, and it
    is the whole reason this type exists rather than a `people.balance_vnd`
    column: a column would be a second answer to a question the ledger already
    answers, and the two would disagree the first time a write half-landed.

    `spend_vnd` is the person's own confirmed allocations -- what the meals
    cost *them*, not what anybody advanced. `outstanding_vnd` is the part of
    that they still owe somebody. `settled_vnd` is the remainder, and it is
    subtraction rather than its own query on purpose: the two figures on screen
    have to add up to the total above them, and deriving one of them from the
    other is the only way to guarantee that without a reconciliation step
    nobody would run.

    `receivable_vnd` is the other direction and belongs to no part of that
    sum. It is what other people still owe *this* person for shares they
    fronted, and money advanced for somebody else was never this person's
    spend -- adding it to the total above would invent an amount nobody owes.
    It exists because every other figure here reads the ledger from the side
    of whoever is in debt, so the person who puts the bill on their own card
    -- which on the demo path is the person running the demo -- had no figure
    on the screen at all.

        Which roles a session may carry was decided by reading the permission
        table rather than by taste. Every action that names `advancer`,
        `recipient`, `sender` or `creditor` also names a predicate the service
        proves from the resource itself -- `is_named_advancer`,
        `is_recipient_of_this_obligation`, `is_creditor_of_this_obligation`,
        `is_own_capability`, `envelope_contains_own_account` -- so carrying
        those four is worth no more than the right to be asked the real
        question. They are granted to any authenticated person for that reason,
        and for the reason that not granting them would 403 every receipt
        confirmation in the product.

        `platform_moderator` is not granted. Its three actions carry no
        predicate at all, so the role alone would be sufficient, and there is
        no table that says who holds it. No route reaches those three actions
        today, so refusing it costs nothing and reserves the decision for the
        migration that introduces a real grant.

        `guest` is not granted either: that subject is a capability digest, not
        a person, and it is built in `_guest_actor`.

        `member` is granted before any membership exists, because being named
        in an invitation is what an invitee has, and `accept_context_membership`
        -- the one action that turns an invitation into a membership -- asks for

        This is the second spelling of `app.domain.post_audience.can_read`, and
        the duplication is deliberate in the same way `uq_friend_edge_live`
        duplicates `friendship.pair_key`: the domain function is what the
        service checks each row against, and this is what stops the rows from
        being fetched at all. Change either and change both -- and note that
        the `tests/api` layer runs against a dict-backed fake, so this spelling
        is exercised only by `tests/postgres/test_posts_postgres.py`.
