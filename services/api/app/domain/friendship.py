"""The friend graph, as a state machine. F03 and F04.

One edge between two people, and the rule that makes it an edge rather than a
claim: **the addressee decides**. A friendship exists when the person who was
asked said yes. Nothing else creates one.

That sentence is the whole reason this module is pure and separate. Written the
ordinary way -- a `friends` table an endpoint inserts into -- "add friend" is a
write the requester performs on somebody else's social graph, and every later
reader (who may see the trip, who may be invited, whose name autocompletes)
inherits a relationship the other person never agreed to. Section 9's confused
deputy, wearing a friendly word.

So there is no `add_friend`. There is `open_request`, which creates a PENDING
edge and grants nothing, and `decide`, which only the addressee may call.
`are_friends` is derived from the resulting state, never stored as its own
truth -- the same shape as invariant 3 for money: the relationship is
recomputable from the events that produced it.

## The four states are the spec's, exactly

`feature_list.md` F04 lists pending, accepted, declined, blocked. They are not
four flags on a row; they are the four places an edge can rest, and the legal
moves between them are the table below.

    PENDING --accept--> ACCEPTED      addressee only
    PENDING --decline-> DECLINED      addressee only
    PENDING --block---> BLOCKED       addressee only
    ACCEPTED -block---> BLOCKED       either party -- friendship can end badly
    DECLINED -----> (reopen)          a new request, not a transition

    BLOCKED --unblock-> DECLINED      the blocker only

DECLINED is deliberately not terminal: being turned down once is not a life
sentence, and the alternative is a product where a mistyped tap permanently
removes somebody from your reachable set. BLOCKED is terminal *for the person
who was blocked*: `open_request` refuses to reopen a blocked edge and refuses
it without saying who blocked whom (see `BLOCKED_IS_SILENT`), so from that
side the wall has no door in it. The person who put the wall up may take it
down -- `unblock`, ADR-0023 §2.3.3 -- and what they get back is DECLINED, not
a friendship: undoing a block must not silently re-create a relationship the
other person agreed to under different circumstances. Blocking twice is the
same wall, not an error.

## Pair keys

`(A asks B)` and `(B asks A)` are the same edge, so state has to be keyed by an
unordered pair. `pair_key` sorts the two ids, which is what lets the database
enforce "at most one live edge per pair" with one unique index instead of two
rows racing each other into a friendship nobody can undo. The SQL index says
the same thing in `least()/greatest()`; keep the two spellings agreeing.

Pure: `dict` in, `dict` out. Raises `FriendshipError`. Imports nothing from
`app.db`, `app.api`, sqlalchemy or fastapi -- `tests/test_import_boundary.py`
parses this file to check that, so the check is not a promise.
