"""F42. The four audiences a post can be addressed to, and who they reach.

Spec section F42 names four levels and stops there. What the spec does not say,
and what this module exists to pin down, is that they are a *vocabulary* and
not a ladder: `friends` and `group` reach disjoint sets of people, and neither
contains the other. Written as a ladder -- the obvious implementation, a rank
comparison like the one in `visibility.py` -- a person who shares a group with
the author reads posts addressed to the author's friends, which is a different
promise from the one the word on the button made.

## Why this module takes facts and not identities

`can_read` is handed `is_friend` and `is_group_member` as booleans that someone
else already proved. It cannot look them up and must not: the whole reason F42
is a privacy feature is that "who are your friends" and "who is in this group"
are answers only the server holds, read from `friend_requests` and
`memberships` at the moment of the read. A version of this function that
accepted a list of friend ids would work identically against a list supplied by
the caller, and the caller is the one person whose claim about their own
membership is worth nothing.

That is also why `friends` is not frozen at write time. Unfriending someone has
to take away what they can see; a recipient list computed when the post was
written would keep them in it forever.

Pure functions over plain dicts. No I/O, no ORM, no framework.
