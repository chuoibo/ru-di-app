"""M11 -- the words a person is allowed to use about their own taste.

## Why the vocabulary is closed, and why it lives in `domain/`

The personalization step used to collect eight taste chips and a budget band
and then say so on screen: «Rủ Đi chỉ dùng lựa chọn này để cá nhân hóa gợi ý
trên máy. Chưa gửi lên máy chủ.» That sentence was true, which is the only
thing that made it acceptable. This module is what makes it false in the
direction the product wanted (ADR-0019 §2.1): the answers now leave the phone.

The vocabulary is a fixed list rather than free text for two reasons that pull
the same way:

* **It is the ground the model stands on.** A suggestion card may say the group
  leans toward cafés only if «cafe» is a word the server knows; free text would
  put whatever somebody typed into a prompt, and there would be no list to
  check the answer against afterwards.
* **It is what makes two people comparable.** «Đồ nướng», «BBQ» and «nướng» are
  one taste written three ways, and a profile that treats them as three has
  quietly stopped being able to count.

It lives in `domain/` because it is a rule about words, not about storage: the
HTTP layer refuses a tag outside the list, the aggregate reads the same list,
and neither may hold its own copy. `tests/test_import_boundary.py` keeps this
file free of the database and the framework.

## What this module deliberately does not decide

It does not say what a tag *means about a place*. That mapping -- which
catalogue rows count as evidence of «Outdoor» -- is about the catalogue and
belongs beside it, not here. This module owns the words and their order.

## Budget is a band, never a number the person typed

Law 1 is integer đồng including intermediate values, and a budget typed as one
number invites the average of a range, which is how `225000.5` gets into a
product with no halves of a đồng. A band is two integers and no arithmetic is
done on them here. The three bands tile without overlapping -- `min_vnd` is
inclusive, `max_vnd` exclusive -- so no amount belongs to two of them.

Skipping the question is a supported answer and is not the cheapest band: the
mockup's own rule is that a skipped budget leaves recommendation on default
rather than guessing hard.
