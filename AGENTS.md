# Repository Guidelines

## Quy tắc toàn repo: Go cho backend, Python chỉ cho AI

Quyết định của Lead ngày 2026-09-21, ADR-0031: toàn bộ backend nghiệp vụ
chuyển sang Go. API, auth, domain, persistence, realtime, điều phối media,
worker, điều phối bot và migration mới viết bằng Go/SQL. Python chỉ dùng cho
inference, extraction và evaluation AI; AI không trực tiếp ghi sổ cái hoặc
quyết định quyền truy cập. Frontend giữ TypeScript; thư viện mã hoá native
được dùng Rust. Comment/docstring tiếng Anh; tài liệu và commit tiếng Việt.

`services/api/` là runtime legacy trong lúc chuyển đổi, không phải mẫu để thêm
backend Python mới. Cho phép sửa lỗi bảo mật/hồi quy và giữ test legacy làm
bằng chứng đối chiếu; phải ghi rõ ngoại lệ trong bàn giao. Không xoá test hay
đổi đường production chỉ để tuyên bố đã chuyển xong. Go chỉ nhận quyền ghi
của module sau khi qua contract và PostgreSQL thật; mỗi module có một writer.

Chat v2 bắt buộc E2EE, không fallback plaintext. Kho cũ chỉ đọc, có nhãn rõ.
Server không giữ khoá giải mã chat. AI chỉ nhận lời gọi hoặc trích đoạn được
đồng ý chia sẻ, không tự đọc chat/gu/lịch sử. Native Android/iOS, kiểm chứng
crypto độc lập và test tải là các cổng riêng, không được thay bằng unit test.

Quy tắc này ưu tiên hơn các mô tả Python-first lịch sử bên dưới. SQLite vẫn
bị cấm làm database backend; kho mã hoá cục bộ trên thiết bị là tầng khác.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Product code lives under `services/api/app/`: `domain/` holds pure rules, `db/` holds SQLAlchemy and Alembic, `api/` exposes FastAPI routes, and `web/` serves guests. There is no payment rail: the product names each person's share and stops, so bank accounts and VietQR left the codebase. Layer-aligned tests live in `services/api/tests/`; root `tests/` covers the repo guard. Consult `docs/decisions/` before behavior changes and `docs/architecture/` before boundary changes. `phase0/` and `docs/protocol/v1/` are frozen. CI treats currently absent `apps/mobile/` and `packages/shared/` as conditional.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pip install -r services/api/requirements-dev.txt` installs pinned Python 3.12 dependencies.
- `docker compose up -d postgres` starts PostgreSQL 16 for migrations and tests.
- `cd services/api && alembic upgrade head` migrates the configured local database.
- `cd services/api && uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload` runs the API with reload.
- `cd services/api && python3 -m app.web.preview` previews the guest page without a database.
- `python3 -m pytest services/api/tests tests -q` runs the standard suite.
- `cd services/api && ruff check . && ruff format --check .` checks style and formatting.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local configuration; never commit `.env`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use four-space indentation, double quotes, an 88-character line limit, and Python 3.12 syntax. Ruff enforces `E4`, `E7`, `E9`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, and `B`. Use `snake_case` for modules/functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. `domain/` must not import `db`, `api`, or `payments`.

Represent VND as integers, preserve exact allocation totals, and derive balances from the ledger. Propose an ADR before changing these invariants.

## Testing Guidelines

Pytest files and functions use `test_*.py` and `test_*`. Add tests beside the affected layer and extend allocator golden JSON vectors. Persistence changes require the live suite in `docs/testing/postgres-repository.md`; fake-repository tests alone are insufficient. No numeric coverage threshold is configured, so cover each changed behavior and regression.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History uses scoped summaries such as `api: ...`, `domain: ...`, `test: ...`, `fix(ci): ...`, and `docs: ...`; keep subjects short, imperative, and focused. PR descriptions must explain what changed and why, list validation performed, link relevant issues or ADRs, and include screenshots for UI changes. Do not self-review. Merge only after an independent reviewer records `APPROVE`; return `REQUEST_CHANGES` work to the author.

## Security & Data Handling

Run `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` to enable the staged repo guard. Never place real participant data, credentials, exports, or temporary copies inside any worktree—even if ignored. Follow `docs/security/repo-guard.md`; `.gitignore` and scanners are mitigation layers, not safe storage.

## Shared Team Invariants (all agents read this file)

This section is the minimum every agent — Claude, Codex, agy — must know before
touching anything. It is duplicated from `CLAUDE.md` on purpose: a clean checkout
must carry the rules, not depend on one harness loading one file.

**Three money laws.** Changing any of them requires an ADR opened first, not a
code change first.

1. Integer dong. No `float`, no `Decimal`, not even in intermediate values.
   `allocator.py` uses `Fraction` to keep exact rationals.
2. `Σ allocations == total expense`, 100%. 41 hand-computed golden vectors hold this.
3. Balances are recomputable from the ledger; a cache is never the source of truth.

Also: editing an expense creates a **new version**, never an overwrite.
`receiver_confirmed` is **not** bank evidence. `completed` is produced only by a
domain transition — there is no "mark as done" button.

**Ownership boundaries** (settled 2026-08-27). Claude owns `app/web/` and
`apps/mobile/`. Codex owns `db/`, `api/`, `payments/`, `domain/` and backend
tests. agy owns no product source — it files findings, not diffs. On the guest
page, routing and data access belong to Codex; a template never queries.

**Layer boundary, enforced by AST parsing, not by promise.** `app/domain/` must
not import `app.db`, `app.api`, `app.payments`, `sqlalchemy`, `fastapi`,
`alembic`, or `pydantic`. See `services/api/tests/test_import_boundary.py`.

**Never put in Git, and never send to an external service**: bill photos, bank
account numbers, participant names, raw transcripts, exports, a real `.env`.
`.gitignore` is not a safe place. Real data lives outside the repo and outside
every worktree. `scripts/repo_guard.py` scans what enters Git; it cannot see what
leaves via an API call.

**Language convention**: docs and commit messages in Vietnamese; code comments
and docstrings in English.

**Frozen in place**: `phase0/` and `docs/protocol/v1/`. Do not edit, do not
delete. `protocol_version` is an immutable snapshot.

**A green test suite is not behavioural evidence.** ADR-0006 gated Phase 0 by
leader decision. Read the "proves / does not prove" table in `CLAUDE.md` before
trusting any green mark.

## Team roles (ADR-0010, 2026-08-27)

Four members: leader (human) plus three agents.

| Role | Who | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Leader | product owner | Gate decisions |
| Engineer | Claude | `app/web/`, `apps/mobile/` |
| Engineer | Codex | `db/`, `api/`, `payments/`, `domain/`, backend tests |
| QA | agy (Gemini) | Product testing — visual, exploratory, API, regression. **Files findings, not diffs. Owns no product source file.** |

All three agents run **two streams at once**: their own planned task, and
reviewing/checking someone else's work. Never sequential, never queued.

**agy boundaries** (full text in ADR-0010 §6):

- agy never fills in `expected` for a golden vector and never produces a money
  answer. It may generate the *frame* and the *input cases* only.
- agy never signs a verdict. `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` / `REJECT` stay with
  the two engineers. A QA finding is input to a reviewer, not a gate.
- **agy's digest is not evidence.** The plugin author observed agy altering its
  own environment (patching installed packages, mock-stubbing deps) to force a
  pass. Whoever delegated re-runs the gate in a clean tree.
- Never `--dangerously-skip-permissions` on this repo — that flag grants
  machine-wide access. Use narrow allow-rules instead.
- QA screenshots come only from `app.web.preview` or synthetic data. Delegating
  means sending content to an outside service; the repo guard scans what enters
  Git, never what leaves.

## What each test layer proves — and does not

| Layer | Proves | Does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/domain/golden/*.json` + `test_golden_selfcheck.py` | The corpus is internally consistent with ADR-0004 | That the corpus author read the contract correctly — one person wrote both |
| `test_selfcheck_catches_mutants.py` | The self-check really does go red on a wrong answer | — |
| `tests/api/` with the fake repository | HTTP ↔ domain orchestration | Any SQL, index, view, or trigger |
| `tests/postgres/` | The real `SqlAlchemyApiRepository` after Alembic migrates a dedicated schema | Every method, every race, every query plan |
| `tests/db/test_migration_matches_models.py` | Migration matches models, no DB needed | — |
| Visual + exploratory QA (agy) | The page renders, reads, and leaks nothing, in the states and viewports **actually scanned** | Whether a real person understands it · which cells went unscanned · that agy did not fake the green |

SQLite is refused on purpose: the production schema depends on JSONB, partial
unique indexes, views, and append-only triggers. New persistence behaviour needs
a matching live case — widening the fake and calling it DB evidence is a lie.
