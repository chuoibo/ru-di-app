# and GitHub -- that this project does not use, and was blind to the one it
# does. Measured on 2026-08-30 in a throwaway repo, same invocation both times:
# a correctly shaped key staged as a `.env` line, a Python literal and a line of
# prose gave "passed staged diff: 3 file scan(s)" and exit 0, while a `ghp_`
# token in the same harness gave one finding and exit 1. The scanner was alive;
# it simply could not see this shape.
#
# `AIza` + 35 of base64url is the published form of a Google API key, which is
# what an AI Studio / Gemini key is. The lookarounds keep it from firing inside
# a longer token. Deliberately NOT a heuristic over variables named `*_KEY`:
# MOBILE_PERSON_ID_KEY has no fixed public shape, and a rule that guesses at
# entropy would land on placeholder values in docs and tests and get switched
# off within a day -- see scripts/gate.sh on gates nobody keeps.

# `google-api-key` is in SECRET_RULES, and secrets are deliberately not
# allowlistable.
#
# The exemption rests on one asymmetry, not on trust: the 35-character body of
# a real key is generated by Google, never chosen by the person committing it.
# So an English marker word inside the body is evidence the value is synthetic,
# in a way that a filename or a variable name -- both freely chosen -- is not.
