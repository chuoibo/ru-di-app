"""Mutation tables for the four place features: F10, F43, F44, F45.

One table per feature, each with two kinds of row.

  CONTROL -- breaks the property the feature exists to hold. The suite must go
  RED. A control row that stays green is a hole: the tests are describing the
  behaviour without constraining it.

  KEEP -- changes a constant while leaving the property intact. The suite must
  stay GREEN. This is the row that distinguishes a gate from a byte-pin, and it
  is the row most often missing: a table where every row is red proves the tests
  react to *edits*, not that they react to *defects*. A gate that goes red when
  somebody tunes a limit is a gate somebody deletes.

## Two hazards this file is written around

**Red for the wrong reason.** A mutation that renames a symbol makes the suite
red with a NameError, which reads exactly like a caught defect. Every row below
substitutes real, in-scope expressions only, and each row names the specific
test it expects to fail so the reason can be checked rather than assumed.

**A no-op mutation.** A replacement whose anchor is absent, or which matches in
two places and patches the wrong one, prints the baseline's verdict and reads as
a working gate. Every anchor is asserted to occur EXACTLY ONCE before it is
used, and the file is asserted to have actually changed afterwards.

Restores from text held in memory rather than `git checkout --`, so running this
against a tree with uncommitted work cannot destroy it.

    python3 scripts/dot_bien_dia_diem_ban_do.py

Exit 0 = every row landed on expectation. Exit 1 = a hole or a byte-pin.
Exit 2 = the harness could not conclude anything, which is not a pass.
