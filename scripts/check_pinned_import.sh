# Load the API with the fastapi version that SHIPS, not the one on this machine.
#
# The gap this closes, measured: `services/api/app/api/routes/memories.py`
# declared a 204 route as `def f() -> None` in a module carrying
# `from __future__ import annotations`. With postponed annotations the return
# annotation resolves to the CLASS `NoneType`, which is truthy, not to the
# `None` singleton, which is not. fastapi 0.115.6 -- the version pinned in
# requirements-dev.txt and therefore the version inside the image -- does
#
#     if self.response_model:
#         assert is_body_allowed_for_status_code(status_code)
#
# at import time, so the app could not be imported at all. fastapi 0.135.3,
# which is what happens to be on the developer PATH here, normalises NoneType
# to None and never reaches the assert. Result: 2305 pytest cases green, and a
# container that exits before it is ever healthy.
#
# Nothing in the test suite could see this, because the test suite imports the
# app with the machine's fastapi. The docker stage could -- and did -- but it
# builds an image, starts a container and waits on a HEALTHCHECK, so in
# practice it was skipped on the PRs that most needed it. This script is the
# same proof at about two seconds: same image, same pins, no container.
#
# Exit codes, matching scripts/gate.sh:
#   0  the app imports under the pinned fastapi
#   1  the app does not import, or the image has drifted off the pin
#   2  the check could not be run at all (no docker) -- never a silent pass

# A known-bad canary, run first, every run. Comparing the image's version

# pin MOVING: fastapi 0.135.3 normalises the deferred `-> None` to None and
# never reaches the assert, so on that version this whole stage would go green
# forever while catching nothing.
#
# So the gate proves it still has teeth before it reports on the real app. The

# canary failed as intended". Measured: that is exactly what happened here
# once. Hence also the message match below rather than a bare exit-code test.
