"""Every route the app calls must exist on the server. Checked offline.

## Why this exists

Nothing in this repository compares the two halves of a request. The server's
tests call the server; the app's tests call a fake. Both stay green while they
disagree, and `src/api.ts` records in its own header comment what that costs:

    "Publishing names its batch. The app called `/batches/current/publish`,
     a route that has never existed."

A call to a route that is not there answers 404 forever. Nothing sees it: the
API suite never calls the app's URL, the mobile suite injects a `fetchImpl`
that answers whatever the test wants, and `tsc` has no opinion about strings.
Measured on 2026-08-29 by putting that exact path back into `api.ts`:
`tsc --noEmit` exited 0 and `npm test` reported 493 passing, 0 failing.

## What it checks

One thing. Path literals in `apps/mobile/src` are normalised (`${x}` and
`{param}` both become the same hole) and matched against the paths FastAPI
itself reports. An unmatched path is a call that can only ever answer 404.

The server side is the *rendered* OpenAPI document, not a list kept by hand. A
list kept by hand is a third copy to drift.

## What it deliberately does not check

Whether a call sends `X-Actor-ID`. That is a real and separate gap -- it cost
the Khám phá screen two hours on `main` the same day -- and it has its own gate
in `scripts/check_actor_headers.py`, which answers it far more thoroughly than
a second copy here would. Two gates that read the same source and can disagree
about it is worse than one gate per question.

## What it does NOT prove

- Nothing here executes a request. Methods, bodies, query parameters, response
  shapes and permission rules are all outside it: a path that exists for GET
  and is called with POST passes. `tests/postgres` and the QA walks are still
  the only things that prove a route does what it says.
- Whether a call is *reachable*. A path written in a module nobody imports
  still counts as called.
- It reads the tree it is in. A route that exists only on an unmerged branch
  counts as missing, which is the honest answer for `main` and the confusing
  one on a feature branch waiting for its API.

## Paths this reader cannot follow

Some are genuinely unfollowable: `call(path, ...)` inside the wrapper every
screen funnels through has no route in it, and `fetch(photo.uri)` is a local
blob rather than an API call at all. Those are pinned in
`.api-contract-unresolved.json` with a reason each.

Pinned, not skipped -- and that distinction is the whole point. Until
2026-08-30 an unfollowable call site contributed nothing but a number to the
summary, and the summary was printed rather than asserted on. So the shape
below passed:

    async function go(path: string) { return call<void>(path, ...); }
    export async function e() { return go("/khong-ton-tai-canary"); }

Measured on this tree at 15726d2, the same non-existent route four ways:
written as a literal, via one const, via `"a" + b`, and via `` `${base}/x` ``
all failed with exit 1 -- and the two shapes above (a path handed to a helper
parameter, and `"/" + parts.join("-")`) exited 0 while `duong_dan_tim_thay`
held at 36 and `lan_goi_doc_duoc` climbed 45 -> 46. That climb is the tell the
old comment here named, and naming a tell nobody checks is not a gate.

Now a call site this reader cannot follow is either pinned or a finding, so
the blind list cannot grow in silence. `scripts/check_actor_headers.py` --
this file's twin, reading the same sources for the adjacent question -- has
worked this way all along; this is that mechanism brought across.

A pin that no longer matches anything is reported too, loudly, but does not
fail the run: it means somebody made the client *more* readable, and a gate
that goes red for an improvement is a gate switched off within a day.

Usage:
  scripts/check_api_contract.py            check the tree this file is in
  scripts/check_api_contract.py --json     the same findings, machine-readable
  scripts/check_api_contract.py --selftest prove the gate can be red, on canaries

Exit codes: 0 client and server agree, 1 they disagree,
2 the check could not run -- and could not run is never a pass.

`2` covers unresolvable URLs too. "The app calls a route that does not exist" is
a defect in the PRODUCT; "I could not follow this URL" is a defect in the GATE,
and until 2026-08-31 both exited 1. Its twin `check_actor_headers.py` had the
same collapse, and at #379 that made QA read a FAIL for a client that was in
fact sending the header correctly.

A blind spot is still RED -- 2 is not 0 and `gate.sh` still blocks. It is only
named correctly. Making it green would be the real bug: a URL this reader cannot
follow may be hiding a route that genuinely does not exist.

    `CANNOT_READ`, never `VIOLATION`. A blind spot is not evidence about the

    the sibling CORS gate.

    Deliberately only asks whether the name still exists, and not the second
    question it looks like it should ask -- "is the reader still matching call
    sites for it". Measured while writing this: `CALLEE` matches the
    *declaration* too, because `function callAsActor<T>(path: string, ...)` has
    the same shape as a call, so a declared wrapper always scores at least one
    site and the question can never answer no. Those phantom sites are what
    the `api.ts :: path: string` entries in the pin file are. Making
    declarations not count is a real fix and a separate one: it moves the
    counts every other check here is calibrated against.

    An empty `WRAPPERS` is its own complaint, and has to be, because the loop
    below expresses "no name is missing" and "there is no name to miss" as the
    same empty list. The second one is the anchor switched off: with no name to
    hold, every rename this function exists to catch walks past it and the gate
    reports agreement. Nothing intentional stops that today -- an empty tuple
    happens to raise `IndexError` while a canary builds `WRAPPERS[0]` at import,
    which is protection by accident, in the wrong place, and under the wrong
    exit code. Measured: give the canaries an empty tuple they tolerate and the
