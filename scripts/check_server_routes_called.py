"""Every route the server declares must have something that calls it.

## Why this exists

`scripts/check_api_contract.py` asks one direction of one question: every path
`apps/mobile` calls must exist on the server. That direction has had a gate
since 2026-08-29.

The other direction had none. A route the server declares that no screen ever
calls does not exist as far as a user is concerned -- it ships, it is tested,
it is merged, and nobody can reach it. `tests/postgres` proves it answers,
`tests/api` proves it orchestrates, the OpenAPI document lists it, and every
one of those stays green while the feature is unreachable.

## Why this is a separate reader from its twin, and not a `not in` flipped

The two directions need opposite scopes, and getting that backwards is how the
two hand-rolled attempts on 2026-08-30 both failed:

  - Substring matching (`"posts" in source`) reported the four `/posts` routes
    from #308 as called. This codebase writes about itself constantly; the word
    "posts" appears in prose in `CheckIn.tsx` and `KyNiem.tsx` and in neither
    case is it a URL. FALSE PASS -- four dead routes called alive.
  - Whole-string matching reported 32 routes dead, including `/places/search`
    and the `/contexts/{id}/messages` family, which the client demonstrably
    calls. The client writes `` `${base}/contexts/${nhomId}/messages` ``; the
    server writes `/contexts/{context_id}/messages`. Same route, different
    text. FALSE FAIL -- and a gate that is wrong about 32 routes on the day it
    lands is a gate nobody runs twice.

Both are avoided by not writing a third URL reader. This file imports the one
`check_api_contract.py` already has -- `tokenize`, `literal_shape`,
`path_from_shape`, `normalise` -- so client and server are compared after the
same normalisation, and `${nhomId}` and `{context_id}` collapse to the same
hole before anything is compared.

## The one place the scope deliberately differs from its twin

`check_api_contract.py` only reads literals reachable from a call to `fetch` /
`call` / `translated`. This file reads EVERY path-shaped literal in
`apps/mobile/src`, whether or not the reader can connect it to a request.

That difference is not an oversight, it is forced by which way a mistake cuts:

  - For "the app calls a route that is not there", a narrow scope is safe. Miss
    a call site and you under-report; you never invent a 404 that is not there.
  - For "nobody calls this route", a narrow scope is the DANGEROUS one. Every
    call the reader cannot follow becomes a route falsely declared dead. The
    pinned blind spots in `.api-contract-unresolved.json` say this outright --
    `taiAnhCoQuyen(url, ...)` hides the path of every image route from the twin
    reader. Measured on main at 8b6f847: under the twin's scope this file would
    report 29 dead routes, under the wider scope 22, and all seven of the
    difference are routes the twin cannot see rather than routes anybody
    deleted.

So the rule here is deliberately generous to the client: if the route is named
anywhere in the client source as a literal, something plausibly calls it and
this gate stays quiet. It still refuses prose, because comments are stripped by
`tokenize` before any literal is read -- which is exactly the distinction the
substring attempt could not make.

## What it does NOT prove

- Not that the call is reachable. A path named in a module nobody imports
  counts as called, the same limitation its twin states about itself.
- Not that the call is correct. Method, body, headers and permissions are all
  outside this: a route named in a literal and called with the wrong verb
  passes here.
- Not that the screen works. `tests/qa` and the QA walks remain the only things
  that prove a user can reach the feature.

## The blind spot this reader cannot close, stated rather than hidden

A URL the SERVER hands to the client never appears in client source, so this
reader structurally cannot see its caller. `AlbumPhoto.image_url`
(`services/api/app/api/schemas.py:1496`) is exactly that: it carries the
`/contexts/{id}/photos/{id}` path in a response body, and the client fetches
whatever arrived. No amount of reading `apps/mobile/src` finds that call.

There is no honest way to detect it from source, so it is not detected -- it is
written down. Such a route belongs in `.server-routes-uncalled.json` with a
reason saying so, and the reason has to name the schema field that carries the
URL, so the next reader can check the claim instead of trusting it. Marking one
of these as "nobody calls it" without that sentence would be this gate telling
the same kind of lie it was built to catch.

It answers exactly one question -- is this route named anywhere on the client
at all -- and a `no` to that is conclusive while a `yes` is only permission for
the other gates to speak.

Usage:
  scripts/check_server_routes_called.py            check the tree this file is in
  scripts/check_server_routes_called.py --json     the same findings, machine-readable
  scripts/check_server_routes_called.py --selftest prove the gate can be red, on canaries

Exit codes: 0 every route has a caller or is accounted for, 1 a route has none,
2 the check could not run -- and could not run is never a pass.
