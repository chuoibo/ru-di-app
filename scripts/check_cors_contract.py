"""Every header and method the app sends must survive the API's CORS preflight.

## Why this exists

`services/api/app/api/cors.py` is careful, and every test that guards it reads
the **server**:

    test_allowed_headers_covers_every_header_the_server_itself_demands()
    test_allowed_methods_covers_every_method_the_routers_expose()

Both derive the expected set from `services/api`. Nothing derives it from the
side that actually sends the bytes -- `apps/mobile/src`. So the one failure
this policy exists to prevent is the one nothing looks for: the client starts
sending a header, the allowlist does not know about it, and the browser
cancels the request at the preflight before a single line of either codebase
runs.

That is not hypothetical. `cors.py` records it happening already, in its own
comment on `Idempotency-Key`:

    "Leaving it out made the API refuse a header it requires -- the browser
     cancelled every write at the preflight, so the web build could not name a
     person or file an expense at all."

Every gate in this repository stayed green through that, and they would stay
green through the next one, because none of them is a browser:

  - `services/api/tests` uses Starlette's `TestClient`, which speaks to the app
    in-process. It can *assert* CORS headers, and it does -- but only for the
    origins, headers and methods the test itself names.
  - `apps/mobile` tests inject a `fetchImpl`. Node's `fetch` does not enforce
    CORS, so a call that a browser would refuse returns 200 here.
  - `scripts/e2e_slice.sh` runs the vertical slice on node, for the same
    reason and with the same blindness. Its own header says so.
  - `expo export` builds the bundle. It never issues a request.

So the two halves of a *preflight* are compared nowhere, exactly as the two
halves of a *path* were compared nowhere until `check_api_contract.py`. This is
that gate, for the other half of the request line.

## What it checks

Two things, both offline, both derived rather than typed by hand:

1.  Every header name `apps/mobile/src` puts on a request is either in
    `app.api.cors.ALLOWED_HEADERS` or CORS-safelisted.
2.  Every HTTP method it sends is either in `app.api.cors.ALLOWED_METHODS` or
    CORS-safelisted.

The server side is imported from `app.api.cors`, never copied here. A copy is a
third thing to drift, and the drift would be invisible in precisely the
direction that matters.

## About the safelist

The Fetch standard lets four request headers through with no allowlist entry:
`Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`. Three of them
are treated as free here. `Content-Type` is **not**, and that is deliberate:
it is only safelisted for three media types, and `application/json` -- what
every write in this app sends -- is not one of them. Treating it as free would
make this gate agree that a JSON write is fine when the browser would refuse
it. It is in `ALLOWED_HEADERS` today, so nothing changes but the reasoning.

Methods are safelisted the same way: `GET`, `HEAD` and `POST` need no entry.

## What it does NOT prove

- That a browser was ever run. It reads two trees. A running server with a
  different `MOBILE_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` can still refuse the origin the web
  build is served from -- that is a deployment question and this is not it.
- That the *origin* is allowed. Only headers and methods.
- That a request succeeds. A preflight that passes says the browser will
  forward the request, nothing about the answer.
- Anything about headers a *third party* is sent. `screens/kham-pha/places.ts`
  talks to a places service, not this API, and its `Accept` header is judged
  here anyway. Being wrong in that direction is loud and cheap to fix; being
  wrong in the other direction is the bug this file exists for.

## Reading a call site it cannot follow

A header object it cannot resolve is a **finding**, not a silence. That is the
lesson `check_api_contract.py` paid for: until 2026-08-30 an unfollowable call
site there contributed a number to a summary nobody asserted on, and a route
that never existed exited 0. Here, an unresolved header position fails the run
and names the file and line.
