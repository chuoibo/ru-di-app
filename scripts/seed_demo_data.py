"""Build the dataset the PoC walkthrough is demonstrated on: one group with a past.

`scripts/seed_dev_data.py` proves the vertical slice answers at all: three
people, one round, one expense. That is the right fixture for "is the stack
alive". It is the wrong one to demo on -- every screen it produces is a screen
in its empty state, and an app whose every list has one row in it reads as
unfinished whether or not it is.

This builds the other thing: seven people, three outings already behind them,
and money still owed. Concretely it exists so that

  * a group screen has a history to scroll,
  * the itemised bill has eight lines assigned to different subsets of people,
    which is the only shape that shows why per-item assignment exists at all,
  * one split does not divide evenly, so the largest-remainder rule is on
    screen rather than only in the golden corpus,
  * and every obligation status the board can render -- outstanding,
    partially_confirmed, confirmed -- is present in real rows.

Every write goes through the HTTP API.
---------------------------------------
`seed_dev_data.py` writes `people` with SQL because when it was written no route
created them. `PUT /people/{id}` exists now, so this script has no SQL write path
at all. That is
not tidiness: a fixture that INSERTs its way around the API can succeed while
the product is broken, and then the demo is the first place anyone finds out.

The one thing read with SQL is "does this group already exist" -- a read, and
there is no route that answers it.

Not one real person, account, or amount
---------------------------------------
Every name here is a bare Vietnamese given name chosen to look ordinary on a
screen and to identify nobody. Account numbers are deliberately not numbers:
they carry letters, so they cannot be mistaken for a real destination and
cannot trip the repo guard's long-number rule either. Nothing in this file may
ever be swapped for something real -- it is committed to Git.

Money is never invented here
----------------------------
The script sends a proposal and echoes back the allocation the API answered
with. It never computes a share. There is exactly one splitter in this product
and it lives in `app/domain/allocator.py`; a second one hiding in a fixture is
how two screens end up showing two numbers for one dinner.
